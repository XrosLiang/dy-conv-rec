It only states that the hack was severe enough to be a threat. It doesn't even remotely state that it's a threat because it's a foreign nation. Why would it matter if it's NK or a private entity? The result is the same either way, and if anything, a private entity could get away with more and would be more dangerous since there's no politics involved.   You're just have no logic here.

My parents got solar on our house, and what we paid in a month, we now pay in a year (if we paid $50 per month, now we pay $50 per year).  That's a nice amount of money to have in your pocket. Renewables can make you money, and (I'm assuming I know a little bit about you based upon what you commented) as a Republican yourself, I know you like money.  So this should be welcomed by you.	why do renewable energy make us a socialist bastard . i 'm a republican , yet i think there be many benefit to wind and solar , example , you can actually make money off of it . my parent get solar on our house , and what we pay in a month , we now pay in a year ( if we pay $ per month , now we pay $ per year ) . that 's a nice amount of money to have in your pocket . renewables can make you money , and ( i 'm assume i know a little bit about you base upon what you comment ) as a republican yourself , i know you like money . so this should be welcome by you .

Almost anyone can get a gun and ammo and shoot you.  If you mean physically hard, shit most killing is done because someone said "kill those guys."   Can't really get any easier than that.

Of course Elon Musk doesn't patent these batteries because its better for everyone that way so other car companies won't be far behind, but since Tesla is the one making them they will be the first to release cars with the cheaper batteries that use them to the full potential. 	tesla 's gigafactory will play a huge factor in this . once tesla 's factory get up and run , battery be go to plummet in price which will allow them to create a cheap car with way long range . of course elon musk do n't patent these battery because its good for everyone that way so other car company wo n't be far behind , but since tesla be the one make them they will be the first to release car with the cheap battery that use them to the full potential .	gmac3001	1420317314	4	0

To make a car cheap is to make a great number of them so that the cost / unit is as close as possible to the cost of materials needed.  What Tesla has going for it though is that their entire production line is being ramped up for the production of electric cars exclusively. When they get more production capacity, I fully expect that they would be able to build a better car for cheaper than Nissan. As I understand it, they have a pretty vertical system where all the important and expensive parts are manufactured themselves.	tesla ca n't get that price point right now due to production capacity . machine and engineer overhead be less per unit the more unit you sell . to make a car cheap be to make a great number of them so that the cost / unit be as close as possible to the cost of material need . what tesla have go for it though be that their entire production line be be ramp up for the production of electric car exclusively . when they get more production capacity , i fully expect that they would be able to build a good car for cheap than nissan . as i understand it , they have a pretty vertical system where all the important and expensive part be manufacture themselves .

With RF, if someone is transmitting with more power, the antenna in your phone will only react to it, meaning you can't communicate with the hotspot. This is essentially what they are doing except instead of transmitting a false Wi-Fi signal like a hijacker would, they are transmitting white noise to prevent any connection from taking place off of their network. They are jamming, which is technically illegal. 	so a transceiver , like the one in your phone , communicate with the hotspot via radio frequency . with rf , if someone be transmit with more power , the antenna in your phone will only react to it , mean you ca n't communicate with the hotspot . this be essentially what they be do except instead of transmit a false wi-fi signal like a hijacker would , they be transmit white noise to prevent any connection from take place off of their network . they be jam , which be technically illegal .	someoneiswrongonline	1420405425	-5	0

But even the 2013 MacBook Pros (sadly with the 5k RPM drives) run 10.9 and 10.10 much slower than if you ran 10.8 or before on them.  It seems to me that the OS has either got a lot more bloat, or it isn't doing I/Os as efficiently as it was in previous versions of the OS.  It takes 10-15 seconds to do the same tasks on the newer OSes.  A minor, but noticeable difference in performance.	as someone who work in an it department that service about computer ( % be mac ) , i can tell you that there be definitely something wrong with the new iteration of the macos . - be great , and run great no matter what hardware you put it on . but even the macbook pro ( sadly with the rpm drive ) run and much slow than if you run or before on them . it seem to me that the o have either get a lot more bloat , or it be n't do i/os as efficiently as it be in previous version of the o . it take second to do the same task on the newer os . a minor , but noticeable difference in performance .	aidenpryde3025	1420436705	21	0

Many of us can charge electric cars at home. I don't think that anyone is seriously suggesting this for hydrogen powered cars.  The one major advantage I can see for hydrogen is that you can refuel a hydrogen car faster than you can recharge an  electric car. That's a valid point, but I'm not sure that it's enough.  It might be a reasonable replacement for jet fuel (or perhaps jets will continue to use hydrocarbons forever), but I don't see it for other cases.	i really do n't know about that . the process for create hydrogen involve create electricity first . electric car skip the `` to hydrogen '' step . many of us can charge electric car at home . i do n't think that anyone be seriously suggest this for hydrogen powered car . the one major advantage i can see for hydrogen be that you can refuel a hydrogen car faster than you can recharge an electric car . that 's a valid point , but i 'm not sure that it 's enough . it might be a reasonable replacement for jet fuel ( or perhaps jet will continue to use hydrocarbon forever ) , but i do n't see it for other case .	lurgi	1420562479	1	0

There certainly are some tradeoffs to society respecting a patent term. The "Have Nots" (people who haven't got a novel idea) get left out in the cold for what seems to be forever. The Haves sometimes get fat and sluggish and sometimes forget how to innovate after a term of exclusivity makes them focus on their first finding and forget how to move forward. Still I doubt there would be nearly as much interest in 3d printing as a prototyping technique if inventors weren't tempted by the chance that they could discover something novel and get something they could hang onto for a while.	i would n't call it a boom . a lot more hat get toss into the ring which look like a boom , but the basic principle do n't move that much far . there certainly be some tradeoff to society respect a patent term . the `` have nots '' ( people who have n't get a novel idea ) get leave out in the cold for what seem to be forever . the have sometimes get fat and sluggish and sometimes forget how to innovate after a term of exclusivity make them focus on their first finding and forget how to move forward . still i doubt there would be nearly as much interest in printing as a prototyping technique if inventor be n't tempt by the chance that they could discover something novel and get something they could hang onto for a while .

Every bitcoin is tied to a public address in the blockchain.  To move those coins, the corresponding private key must sign that transaction, and every transaction is irreversible.  So when a person or company gets hacked, the hacker actually copies that private key, and uses it to sign an irreversible transaction to send the coins to an address that only he controls.  That is how bitcoins are stolen.  Not sure if I did the best job explaining that, so if something isn't clear, feel free to ask me.	all bitcoins be record in a public ledger know as the blockchain , which be available to everyone who want to download it and/or view it . every bitcoin be tie to a public address in the blockchain . to move those coin , the corresponding private key must sign that transaction , and every transaction be irreversible . so when a person or company get hack , the hacker actually copy that private key , and use it to sign an irreversible transaction to send the coin to an address that only he control . that be how bitcoins be steal . not sure if i do the best job explain that , so if something be n't clear , feel free to ask me .	sod6	1420570621	2	0

Technology exists to subdivide spectrum into numerous channels on a single band, yet so far only a doubling is implemented because there is no incentive to admitting there's actually no capacity limitation on spectrum.   Doubling has existed since the late 90's, when everything shifted to digital radio and enabled the transmission of wireless data. And it's stayed with doubling, because ATT and Verizon like to hoard spectrum and lock out competitors so they can charge you more money. 	spectrum limit be bullshit , artificial creation use to justify the data cap . technology exist to subdivide spectrum into numerous channel on a single band , yet so far only a doubling be implement because there be no incentive to admit there 's actually no capacity limitation on spectrum . doubling have exist since the late 's , when everything shift to digital radio and enable the transmission of wireless data . and it 's stay with doubling , because att and verizon like to hoard spectrum and lock out competitor so they can charge you more money .	reddisaurus	1420600585	0	0

And this is already in an American system where selection into universities is often race based to fill a criteria, and white and Asian males who are more capable are excluded based on racist admission policies.	i do n't understand this article at all ! it say we want equality , then immediately afterwards it say we will only give money to black college . how be that equal ? have the definition of equal opportunity somehow change ? and this be already in an american system where selection into university be often race base to fill a criterion , and white and asian male who be more capable be exclude base on racist admission policy .

Which is why I didn't participate in the voting. I don't want to vote for the lesser of two evils. My point is, don't blame the people who voted one choice over another when both possible options were 100% fucked from the beginning due to the process in which the possible choices are given. That is not on them, nor is it on you or myself. That's on the system that's been put in place and exported/manipulated into corralling our possible choices down to two possible "damned if you do, damned if you don't" end scenarios.	while i agree with you , i also want to point out that have romney win the election instead , the result would have be the same or bad . which be why i do n't participate in the voting . i do n't want to vote for the less of two evil . my point be , do n't blame the people who vote one choice over another when both possible option be % fuck from the begin due to the process in which the possible choice be give . that be not on them , nor be it on you or myself . that 's on the system that 's be put in place and exported/manipulated into corral our possible choice down to two possible `` damn if you do , damn if you do n't '' end scenario .	esadatari	1420764540	3	0

GE's marketing team must be pretty good -- look at all the coverage they're getting here!  In any case, /u/jpgray covered it *reasonably* well.  Indeed MR is the cadillac for imaging but there's many kinds of imaging for which it's poorly suited and CT is better so.  AMA.

The dose is better (lower) than prior products released by GE for most/many cases though probably not all.

The battery system isn't designed that way right now since there's no installed based of banks of capacitors.

I imagine this will be useful in the future, provided there can be at least *some* form of standardization on battery technology.  In terms of capacity? I imagine manufacturers will probably shoot for like a 400 mile range (roughly 150 KWH, if the Model S is a good representation), and then keep decreasing the physical size of the battery as technology improves. I hope that we'll have options for massive batteries, but that seems unlikely. After all, most gasoline cars only get about 300-350 miles per tank, regardless of the gas milage.   In terms of energy density limits? How small can a 150 KWH battery get? I'm not sure.

01_00921	t1_cnmis89	t1_cnmfkpv	It's not just that.  It's the relation of energy to heat and current.    Example: A Battery that drains from full to empty in 1 hour is said to be a 1amp-hour batter (or 1000milli-amp-hour, etc.).  To charge it, you can put 1 amp into it in an hour and charge it or 2 amps for 30 minutes, or 4 amps for 15 minutes, etc.    Electric cars have batteries in the 60amp hour range (usually specified in kWHrs, but that's another story).  To charge it at 10x (6 minutes) it requires 600 amps (not including other losses).  That's a lot of amps!  The wires have to be super-thick to avoid melting.  It gets heavy and huge.    Let's just say I'm skeptical.	it 's not just that . it 's the relation of energy to heat and current . example : a battery that drain from full to empty in hour be say to be a batter ( or , etc. ) . to charge it , you can put amp into it in an hour and charge it or amp for minute , or amp for minute , etc . electric car have battery in the hour range ( usually specify in kwhrs , but that 's another story ) . to charge it at ( minute ) it require amp ( not include other loss ) . that 's a lot of amp ! the wire have to be super-thick to avoid melting . it get heavy and huge . let 's just say i 'm skeptical .

A cable large enough to carry that much current is infeasible, not to mention all the internal relays / cabling / bus bars in the car and actually building a megawatt-scale charging station and all that goes along with that.  A 3 minute charge isn't *impossible*, but it requires more than just popping in a new kind of battery - it requires a completely re-engineered electric car and charging infrastructure.	& gt ; be talk about wire capable of carry amp . to charge kwh in minute would require that amperage . a cable large enough to carry that much current be infeasible , not to mention all the internal relay / cable / bus bar in the car and actually build a megawatt-scale charging station and all that go along with that . a minute charge be n't *impossible* , but it require more than just pop in a new kind of battery - it require a completely re-engineered electric car and charge infrastructure .	fooljoe	1421083774	1	0

Given that most people charge their EVs at home while they sleep, and Tesla's existing Supercharger paradigm already makes long trips quite workable, I just don't see the expense ever being justified. If super fast charging ever were to come to pass I'd bank on battery swapping taking off rather than megawatt-scale charging stations.	yeah , i 'm sure it 's possible , and it 's fun to think about design such a super high power charge station , but the question be just whether it would ever be practical to go to all that trouble . give that most people charge their ev at home while they sleep , and tesla 's exist supercharger paradigm already make long trips quite workable , i just do n't see the expense ever be justify . if super fast charge ever be to come to pass i 'd bank on battery swap take off rather than megawatt-scale charge station .	fooljoe	1421098010	1	0

There might be the occasional person who gets a 70-80 incher, maybe someone who throws a lot of football-related parties and the like.

It would be nice if you could only vote in your field, but it would be completely impossible to determine that on a mass scale. What a shame.

They don't use ratios in chemical names because then one might confuse h2o for h4o2. Simplified example I concede and while h4o2 is not a stable molecule, and water is unlikely to be confused with it due to its lack of existence in nature, your ratio naming system breaks down when it comes to polymers like polysaccharides.  Peroxide refers to the free radical nature of the molecule AFAIK, it's not the same as dioxide because there's a free valent electron on the oxygens (I'm open to correction on this)  Dihydrogen monoxide is water.	afraid not , monoxide be not the same as peroxide . the 'per- ' in peroxide do not refer to a ratio of one hydrogen per oxygen . they do n't use ratio in chemical name because then one might confuse for . simplified example i concede and while be not a stable molecule , and water be unlikely to be confuse with it due to its lack of existence in nature , your ratio name system break down when it come to polymer like polysaccharide . peroxide refers to the free radical nature of the molecule afaik , it 's not the same as dioxide because there 's a free valent electron on the oxygen ( i 'm open to correction on this ) dihydrogen monoxide be water .	hungry4nuns	1421262362	2	0

Rural areas needed more wire and poles per customer, because the population density was lower.  The added cost made it less profitable, so power companies didn't want to do it.  The customers themselves were willing to pay the extra cost of getting power, because electricity is so useful.  So they ended up with cooperatively owned power companies.

By sucking in the air from the front of the vehicle, and spitting it out the cushion slots, you negate the drag from a low vacuum (like 1% normal air pressure).  Thus you can get by with much smaller vacuum pumps along the pipe, and can tolerate small leaks letting a bit getting in.  Airplanes can cruise at 1/3 normal air pressure for about 10 hours using the fuel they carry and jet engines (which have fans and compressors) to negate the drag.  If you are only fighting 1% air pressure, and the trips are an hour rather than 10, you can get by with much less energy.  So on-board batteries or coils along the tube become practical ways to supply the necessary power.	it take exponentially more vacuum pump work to get a high vacuum level . by suck in the air from the front of the vehicle , and spit it out the cushion slot , you negate the drag from a low vacuum ( like % normal air pressure ) . thus you can get by with much small vacuum pump along the pipe , and can tolerate small leak let a bit get in . airplane can cruise at normal air pressure for about hour use the fuel they carry and jet engine ( which have fan and compressor ) to negate the drag . if you be only fight % air pressure , and the trip be an hour rather than , you can get by with much less energy . so on-board battery or coil along the tube become practical way to supply the necessary power .	danielravennest	1421376300	7	0

The municipalities would argue that Uber runs what is essentially a virtual taxi stand, and therefore must be licensed to operate as a taxi operator in that jurisdiction. Uber will just show up in a town and do whatever the hell they want, claiming that they're above regulation because as you say, it's just an app. So it's a legal grey area until something is put on the books that directly addresses it.	the problem be there be no specific law to address something like uber , as you say . that 's why they get kick out of town that do n't like them . the municipality would argue that uber run what be essentially a virtual taxi stand , and therefore must be license to operate as a taxi operator in that jurisdiction . uber will just show up in a town and do whatever the hell they want , claim that they 're above regulation because as you say , it 's just an app . so it 's a legal grey area until something be put on the book that directly address it .

You simply cannot make encryption that's safe against entities outside your own government and with only *your* government having access.  It's not that we shouldn't do it... It's that we can't.  The two goals are contradictory.  The only way to do it would be non-technical.  (i.e. The government has no technical access but has the legal right to keep you in jail until you decrypt it.

There is also Old Navy, Kohls, Belk, places like Dress barn, Shoe Carnival, as well as smaller chains and unique one of a kind stores. These stores, together, can more than support the weight of a Wal-Mart-less society. Many people already don't buy clothes from Wal-Mart, like myself. I find I prefer paying between the same price and 10 bucks more per article to avoid Wal-mart and get same quality/higher quality clothes.

01_01488	t1_cnucyql	t1_cnu6oyg	You're correct about the shrink/swell reduction that fiber provides, and in this purpose it can serve as a replacement for welded wire mesh in slabs and other flatwork. Where it differs from reinforcing steel, especially vertical steel, is that it provides no additional structural integrity. That's what I've been taught, anyway.  Some concrete crews can be seen putting in verticals after the mud has been poured, but that certainly isn't an accepted practice as specified by the ASTM to my knowledge. Verticals will be in place and either tied or welded to the horizontal pieces prior to placement of concrete. Again, I'm not the absolute authority, just an ACI level 2 concrete inspector and steel inspector. 	you 're correct about the shrink/swell reduction that fiber provide , and in this purpose it can serve as a replacement for welded wire mesh in slab and other flatwork . where it differ from reinforce steel , especially vertical steel , be that it provide no additional structural integrity . that 's what i 've be taught , anyway . some concrete crew can be see put in vertical after the mud have be pour , but that certainly be n't an accepted practice as specify by the astm to my knowledge . vertical will be in place and either tie or weld to the horizontal piece prior to placement of concrete . again , i 'm not the absolute authority , just an aci level concrete inspector and steel inspector .	wants_a_lollipop	1421711213	2	0
01_01488	t1_cnudwyv	t1_cnu6oyg	The steel rebar also counteracts shear and torsional forces applied to the concrete. Concrete is great in compression but is super brittle and can't take much in tension.  I don't believe if the steel is distributed through the mix it will provide anywhere near the same function as the rebar does. Otherwise I feel they would just add steel as an aggregate in the mixing stage to save workforce costs in setting rebar.   I'd imagine they could print the rebar straight into position in the concrete or print holes for it to be placed into after.   But I don't know much about 3d printing and its material properties so I could be wrong.	the steel rebar also counteract shear and torsional force apply to the concrete . concrete be great in compression but be super brittle and ca n't take much in tension . i do n't believe if the steel be distribute through the mix it will provide anywhere near the same function as the rebar do . otherwise i feel they would just add steel as an aggregate in the mixing stage to save workforce cost in set rebar . i 'd imagine they could print the rebar straight into position in the concrete or print hole for it to be place into after . but i do n't know much about printing and its material property so i could be wrong .	kingcomet32	1421712877	1	0

01_01552	t1_cnv5rxe	t1_cnv4iiy	But the GOP is trying to make us think they care.  They are framing this as a net neutrality bill even though it still allows prioritization based on consumer demands or something along those lines.  It further erodes consumer rights by stripping the FCC of its power.  And you are correct.  Telecoms done fucked up by fighting NN as they opened the can of worms of Title II.  They would have been much better off to come to a 'gentleman's agreement' and stated a coalition of 'X' telecoms will voluntarily not partake in prioritization of any kind.  That would have easily dodged this for them.  But instead they have been greedy.  So screw them.	but the gop be try to make us think they care . they be frame this as a net neutrality bill even though it still allow prioritization base on consumer demand or something along those line . it further erodes consumer right by strip the fcc of its power . and you be correct . telecom do fuck up by fight nn as they open the can of worm of title ii . they would have be much good off to come to a 'gentleman 's agreement ' and state a coalition of ' x ' telecom will voluntarily not partake in prioritization of any kind . that would have easily dodge this for them . but instead they have be greedy . so screw them .

The authorities still need to meet the same criteria for obtaining a warrant as before, but now they can get the warrant from the jurisdiction where the crime occurred, not just where the criminal is.    Right now, if the FBI has evidence of a crime, they can get a warrant and remotely access a user's files. If the user is hiding behind a VPN, the FBI can't determine in which jurisdiction they should obtain the warrant, and no judge could issue a warrant *even possibly* outside their jurisdiction.

The two markets SpaceX is in, Commercial Launches, and soon, Commercial satellite production are both extremely internationally competitive and thus fairly thin profit margins, and the former extremely heavily subsidized by governments.   Weapons usually have crazy profit margins and those sweet, sweet, no-bid, cost-plus contracts.  Now, it might actually be a good idea to go into weapons and use the profits to help fund Mars. But I think the assumption is that the push to abandon Mars entirely would be too great.	i do n't think he 's ever say this specifically , but there 's likely an assumption that investor would want to turn it into a military contractor make weapon . the two market spacex be in , commercial launch , and soon , commercial satellite production be both extremely internationally competitive and thus fairly thin profit margin , and the former extremely heavily subsidize by government . weapon usually have crazy profit margin and those sweet , sweet , no-bid , cost-plus contract . now , it might actually be a good idea to go into weapon and use the profit to help fund mar . but i think the assumption be that the push to abandon mar entirely would be too great .	jivatman	1421853687	1	0

The $40 they charged me didn't kill me or anything, but it was highly annoying. I would assume they would do the same again. Same deal, if they charge me $40 it wouldn't be the end of the world but at that point I may as well just buy 10 when it comes out.

01_01741	t1_cnxcie8	t1_cnx495m	Yes, the F-150 is a really nice truck. It's lighter, more fuel efficient, and more power in some trims. Overall it is a better truck than the outgoing model.  However, the issue is that people feel cheated by having speakers play engine sounds in the cabin. They hear engine sounds and think they are coming from the engine itself, but then they find out that they are just hearing an audio clip.  People with an interest in cars like yourself want to hear what the engine is actually doing. You would be gutted if your Hyundai Genesis Coupe's 3.8 liter engine had a valve tick that developed into a bigger problem when you could have diagnosed it on a casual drive and simply reset the valve clearances.	yes , the be a really nice truck . it 's light , more fuel efficient , and more power in some trim . overall it be a good truck than the outgoing model . however , the issue be that people feel cheat by have speaker play engine sound in the cabin . they hear engine sound and think they be come from the engine itself , but then they find out that they be just hear an audio clip . people with an interest in car like yourself want to hear what the engine be actually do . you would be gutted if your hyundai genesis coupe 's liter engine have a valve tick that develop into a big problem when you could have diagnose it on a casual drive and simply reset the valve clearance .	mrcnja	1421947661	1	0

01_01741	t1_cnxd029	t1_cnxcqep	Personally, piping the sound in or around the cabin still feels a little weird to me, but I see it as significantly better than using speakers. Piping adds a little more clutter to the engine bay, but what you hear is the sound that *your* engine is genuinely producing. It also adds the advantages you mention--quiet when you a puttering around the neighborhood, but loud when you hit the throttle. The big issue with the speaker system is that the sound you are hearing isn't even from your engine or your car.	personally , pip the sound in or around the cabin still feel a little weird to me , but i see it as significantly good than use speaker . pip add a little more clutter to the engine bay , but what you hear be the sound that *your* engine be genuinely produce . it also add the advantage you mention -- quiet when you a putter around the neighborhood , but loud when you hit the throttle . the big issue with the speaker system be that the sound you be hear be n't even from your engine or your car .	mrcnja	1421948465	1	0

Unlike BlackBerry, which allows iPhone users to download and use our BBM service, Apple does not allow BlackBerry or Android users to download Apple’s iMessage messaging service. Netflix, which has forcefully advocated for carrier neutrality, has discriminated against BlackBerry customers by refusing to make its streaming movie service available to them. Many other applications providers similarly offer service only to iPhone and Android users. This dynamic has created a two-tiered wireless broadband ecosystem, in which iPhone and Android users are able to access far more content and applications than customers using devices running other operating systems.

If more people start using it for regular conversations, they'll probably put more effort into cracking it.  Speaking of which though, Tor is over a decade old now, and it's been of unending interest to them.

The industry, or at least parts of it, want self-driving cars. And in the beginning they are going to do their damndest to keep that software as illegal to access as possible. I suspect anyone other than licensed mechanics are going to be disallowed from accessing it. This is because said software will most likely have glaring vulnerabilities to exploit.  So, expect zero moving off from the industry on this one.	here 's the thing : ignore the right or wrong side of this , there be a very practical reason why this be go to stick . the industry , or at least part of it , want self-driving car . and in the beginning they be go to do their damndest to keep that software as illegal to access as possible . i suspect anyone other than licensed mechanic be go to be disallow from access it . this be because say software will most likely have glare vulnerability to exploit . so , expect zero move off from the industry on this one .

Those downstream channels are shared channels, that means multiple modems all sharing that 38MBps pipe. This was a serious issue with DOCSIS 2.0 where modems only used a single channel. With DOCSIS 3 it is less of an issue because there are multiple channels and there will be multiple modems connected to a blend of channels to ease load balancing.  To say that it costs them nothing on a DOCSIS 2.0 network is accurate, if you were the only customer on that channel.

MVNOs are great, but they have come about through private bargaining rather than mandates.  On the one hand, OANs would be good for consumer choice and possibly for lowering prices in the near term (which would both be good things).  On the other hand, I think OANs would have a detrimental impact on the incentives of facilities owning ISPs to invest in maintaining, expanding, and/or improving their networks.

01_02084	t1_co2d6pe	t1_co2cpnr	I have seen some people state that portions of cell service reside under Title II already, which I assumed is the reason MVNOs exist. I cannot see these same telecoms willingly leasing their lines unless MVNOs are THAT profitable for them.  Google is not going to rollout nationwide due to local laws and the telecoms owning the poles, thus controlling the rights and prices to access said poles.  I do worry a bit about investment with forced OANs, but the investment is already very lackluster so there would really only be a minimal loss. That, and I have seen other countries go this route and not have problems.  There would have to be a way to enable investment, I just don't have that answer. 	i have see some people state that portion of cell service reside under title ii already , which i assume be the reason mvnos exist . i can not see these same telecom willingly lease their line unless mvnos be that profitable for them . google be not go to rollout nationwide due to local law and the telecom own the pole , thus control the right and price to access say pole . i do worry a bit about investment with forced oans , but the investment be already very lackluster so there would really only be a minimal loss . that , and i have see other country go this route and not have problem . there would have to be a way to enable investment , i just do n't have that answer .

You will end up with *some* people slowing down while others won't even be aware there is a cop nearby. This increases the chance of accidents because you have some people slowing down out of nowhere which causes issues for the rest of traffic.

Put it on anything other than auto at any time? Buffers and won't play a video, have to quit the app. Every official YouTube app from Google has been a completely worthless piece of shit in my opinion. Protube, McTube and MXTube have all been better and I will never go go to their official POS app because no version has ever been any good. 	i 've have that behavior in every version of a youtube app release on io . i have a connection , buffer if you touch the slider . put it on anything other than auto at any time ? buffer and wo n't play a video , have to quit the app . every official youtube app from google have be a completely worthless piece of shit in my opinion . protube , mctube and mxtube have all be well and i will never go go to their official po app because no version have ever be any good .

01_02257	t1_co4p14w	t1_co4okyk	This-   I think there is a reasonable amount that could be charged ($3-4/mo)  assuming we are responsible for the cost of replacing the equipment if it breaks.   Truck rolls to do even basic things like this can often cost upwards of $150.00 each time.  Additionally if customers did want to purchase it we would make replacement of defective equipment outside of the warranty period their financial responsibility.  The problem i foresee with this is that people tend to forget whether they own or rent their equipment and policies regarding cost to the customer don't often sit well even if they were explained precisely in the past when they ordered their service.  This can result in unhappy customers.     I guess finding an easy way to show that info to the customers would be the best solution.	this- i think there be a reasonable amount that could be charge ( $ ) assuming we be responsible for the cost of replace the equipment if it break . truck roll to do even basic thing like this can often cost upwards of $ each time . additionally if customer do want to purchase it we would make replacement of defective equipment outside of the warranty period their financial responsibility . the problem i foresee with this be that people tend to forget whether they own or rent their equipment and policy regard cost to the customer do n't often sit well even if they be explain precisely in the past when they order their service . this can result in unhappy customer . i guess find an easy way to show that info to the customer would be the best solution .	jason_w87	1422546752	1	0

The removable battery and expandable storage are the one thing Samsung has that no one else bothers with, and it is great, it puts the power in the hand of the user to pick an appropriate battery size and amount of storage to suit their needs.  Also, just to clarify on why lighter is better in phones. Force=Mass x Acceleration. Acceleration is gravity and is largely constant, so mass is the only thing you can limit to reduce the screen shattering force with which a phone hits the ground. In this case, lighter means less force, means less risk of damage.	plastic be light than metal , do n't bend permanently like metal phone seem to , and with a nice rubber coating can feel pretty good in the hand . the removable battery and expandable storage be the one thing samsung have that no one else bother with , and it be great , it put the power in the hand of the user to pick an appropriate battery size and amount of storage to suit their need . also , just to clarify on why lighter be well in phone . force=mass x acceleration . acceleration be gravity and be largely constant , so mass be the only thing you can limit to reduce the screen shatter force with which a phone hit the ground . in this case , light mean less force , mean less risk of damage .	ben7337	1422599111	1	0

The only reason for the FCC to have a mandated performance to be considered broadband is so that in contracts with ISPs that suggest they get a certain amount of funding or tax breaks as a result of a certain amount of the population in the ISPs market having access to a certain speed. This is to help keep the speed of innovation in terms of internet offering as well as technology going forward instead of stagnating. Unfortunately when the Broadband definition doesn't change rapidly enough, stagnation happens anyways.

01_02370	t1_co5rqyv	t1_co5qht7	IPv4 address exhaustion happened back in 2011, when APNIC (the region india is in) reserved the final few blocks available for IP addresses. Basically, there's no more high level blocks for regions to reserve for more addresses, not necessarily that all addresses are "taken". The region probably has the needed addresses in its reserve.  Since then, we've only been mitigating with short-term solutions while IPv6 is being worked on.	address exhaustion happen back in , when apnic ( the region india be in ) reserve the final few block available for ip address . basically , there 's no more high level block for region to reserve for more address , not necessarily that all address be `` take '' . the region probably have the need address in its reserve . since then , we 've only be mitigate with short-term solution while be be work on .	eerongal	1422631943	5	0

The standard is there, and ready, and new OS's and such have support for it, the only thing holding it back is people not updating to, and using it.   However, it is one of those things, we can't just flip a switch and make everything use IPv6. There's huge hardware and infrastructure changes that need to be carried out. For now, most things are just using NAT as an interim work around (which is also cheaper than upgrading hardware to IPv6).   So really, the only thing left to "do" is use it, but that's easier said than done :P  It should be noted that adoption rates ARE climbing, just not particularly fast.	at this point , it 's mostly just adoption . the standard be there , and ready , and new o 's and such have support for it , the only thing hold it back be people not update to , and use it . however , it be one of those thing , we ca n't just flip a switch and make everything use . there 's huge hardware and infrastructure change that need to be carry out . for now , most thing be just use nat as an interim work around ( which be also cheap than upgrade hardware to ) . so really , the only thing leave to `` do '' be use it , but that 's easy say than do :p it should be note that adoption rate be climb , just not particularly fast .	eerongal	1422636685	9	0
01_02370	t1_co5uudb	t1_co5uik2	Also worth noting: When I say "people just need to use it", i don't necessarily mean someone converting their home network to IPv6, that's not likely to do much. We mostly need ISPs/data centers/etc. to convert over to using it. So your ISP needs to start putting all the equipment together for IPv6, upgrading whatever infrastructure needed, sending customers updated hardware, etc. for it to become a thing vs you changing anything with your network. Granted, I'm sure IPv4 will be phased out completely some day, but certainly not day 1.	also worth note : when i say `` people just need to use it '' , i do n't necessarily mean someone convert their home network to , that 's not likely to do much . we mostly need isps/data centers/etc . to convert over to use it . so your isp need to start put all the equipment together for , upgrade whatever infrastructure need , send customer update hardware , etc . for it to become a thing v you change anything with your network . grant , i 'm sure will be phase out completely some day , but certainly not day .	eerongal	1422637231	3	0

As the WSJ points out, this is only a small portion of the company's annual sales of $183 billion sales, but it's huge compared to the costs of running the App Store — meaning it's still a "meaningful contributor" to the company's profits.	accord to [ the verge ] ( <URL> ) apple make about $ billion in revenue in from the app store and that the operating cost for run the app store be significantly low than that $ billion they make . & gt ; this mean that last year the app store saw total sale of around $ billion ( it be $ billion in ) of which apple take home some $ billion . as the wsj point out , this be only a small portion of the company 's annual sale of $ billion sale , but it 's huge compare to the cost of run the app store — mean it 's still a `` meaningful contributor '' to the company 's profit .	wayward_wanderer	1422656241	3	0

I've used it a lot and it's really nice.
