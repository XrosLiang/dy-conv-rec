For example in one study researchers elongated the tails of male widowbirds and females ended up preferring the longest tails. This confirms run away sexual selection and that females drive certain traits to the extreme but natural selection keeps this in check since long tails are a handicap. But there is a reason females gravitate towards long tails despite them being a handicap for the male. It might show he is a survivor, has good genes, or can forage well. Either way you can't dismiss something you probably know nothing about. 	you know there 's actually some solid research on sexual selection . for example in one study researcher elongate the tail of male widowbirds and female end up prefer the long tail . this confirm run away sexual selection and that female drive certain trait to the extreme but natural selection keep this in check since long tail be a handicap . but there be a reason female gravitate towards long tail despite them be a handicap for the male . it might show he be a survivor , have good gene , or can forage well . either way you ca n't dismiss something you probably know nothing about .	vulpes21	1430846889	5	0

Psychiatric drugs didn't really come about until the 50s. Some were known, but the action wasn't necessarily understood. Lithium had been known much earlier, but it was only rediscovered through medical studies in 1949. In fact lithium wasn't actually approved by the FDA until 1970.   Hell, there wasn't even mass production of penicillin in 1941. It's a freakishly long time ago in terms of modern medicine.

The DC metro has been covered in "lethistorydecide.org" ads, and UMD busses have their "factcheckarmenia.com."

If Germany couldn't win the war, Hitler wanted Germany to commit national suicide, and in pursuing this goal he kept fighting long after it became clear that victory was impossible. He put out his infamous [Nero Decree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Decree) near the end in pursuit of the same goal (it wasn't followed, due to the intercession of Albert Speer). Towards the end, most of the high-ranking Nazis made attempts to contact the Allies and negotiate a surrender, behind Hitler's back. Other than Hitler, no one really wanted to go down in flames. What it all means is that if Hitler had been killed in 1943, Germany would have surrendered months sooner than it did, with far less destruction and loss of life.	something would have change . if germany could n't win the war , hitler want germany to commit national suicide , and in pursue this goal he keep fight long after it become clear that victory be impossible . he put out his infamous [ nero decree ] ( <URL> ) near the end in pursuit of the same goal ( it be n't follow , due to the intercession of albert speer ) . towards the end , most of the high-ranking nazi make attempt to contact the ally and negotiate a surrender , behind hitler 's back . other than hitler , no one really want to go down in flame . what it all mean be that if hitler have be kill in , germany would have surrender month sooner than it do , with far less destruction and loss of life .	malektewaus	1430964630	2	0

A shell will explode and creates uranium dust which is then inhaled or gets into food and enters the bloodstream. A person might as well enjoy a plate of lead based paint chips for breakfast. The heavy metal toxicity is exacerbated by the vapors and residues left over from the high explosives themselves, which are also highly toxic.   Uranium itself is radioactive, but it has a half life of 4.5 billion years, so it it not dangerously radioactive at all.	the big issue with depleted uranium be heavy metal poison as it have biological toxicity similar to mercury or lead . a shell will explode and create uranium dust which be then inhale or get into food and enter the bloodstream . a person might as well enjoy a plate of lead base paint chip for breakfast . the heavy metal toxicity be exacerbate by the vapor and residue leave over from the high explosives themselves , which be also highly toxic . uranium itself be radioactive , but it have a half life of billion year , so it it not dangerously radioactive at all .	whattothewhonow	1431429038	4	0

It's just an ectoparasite that drinks the bee equivalent of blood (haemolymph).

I just want to say that over the years they've done a great job of portraying abuse as something that can come from both parties. They deserve some credit. I've seen nearly as many women arrested for domestic abuse as men, and often when it happens I question whether it's legit. We all have these preconceived notions in our heads about how things are supposed to go down, and it bothers me a bit to think my own judgement is probably even worse than theirs - looking at the statistics in this thread title.	i watch a lot of cop . like a lot . i might have a problem . i just want to say that over the year they 've do a great job of portray abuse as something that can come from both party . they deserve some credit . i 've see nearly as many woman arrest for domestic abuse as men , and often when it happen i question whether it 's legit . we all have these preconceive notion in our head about how thing be suppose to go down , and it bother me a bit to think my own judgement be probably even bad than theirs - look at the statistic in this thread title .	stansteamer	1432975735	155	0

In one scene, Ramón is seen using a tape recorder to play back the tones used by a payphone to signal the CO that a quarter had been dropped into the slot.  Rather than use the actual tones, they substituted a bunch of random dialling tones.  Incidentally, this trick actually used to work.  Maybe it still does if you can find a payphone to victimize with it.	a similar thing happen in the movie *hackers* . in one scene , ramón be see use a tape recorder to play back the tone use by a payphone to signal the co that a quarter have be drop into the slot . rather than use the actual tone , they substitute a bunch of random dial tone . incidentally , this trick actually use to work . maybe it still do if you can find a payphone to victimize with it .

Since we were made in God's image, the extension is obvious.

This is why some of the most beautiful mosques on Earth are decorated with patterns of dots. Dots are safe.

It took about 6 weeks for him to break and quit but when he did he bought her a car for being so nice.

Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs until she died.

05_09717	t1_crorf6g	null	This comment is based on a common but unfortunate misunderstanding.  The $10/day here isn't about what 10 American dollars would buy in a poor country.  The $10/day here refers to what $10 *would* buy in the US in a day.  So when the World Bank says people live on less that $1/day, they mean less than what $1 *would* buy in the US.  It is called "Purchase Power Parity" or "PPP."  So, for example, if $10/day in the US does not buy a safe place to live, or enough healthy food, then "$10/day PPP" also does not buy those things.  "$10 PPP" buys the same amount of stuff anywhere and everywhere. (I'm a professor and I publish peer reviewed journal articles on global poverty.)	this comment be base on a common but unfortunate misunderstanding . the $ here be n't about what american dollar would buy in a poor country . the $ here refers to what $ *would* buy in the u in a day . so when the world bank say people live on less that $ , they mean less than what $ *would* buy in the u . it be call `` purchase power parity '' or `` ppp .

A Faraday Cage does use something similar, though; you may have seen someone stand inside a metal cage next to a Van de Graaff generator and touch the metal without getting shocked.	it 's actually something call the [ skin effect ] ( <URL> ) . basically , high-frequency current like to ride on the outside of a conductor , so there 's relatively little charge at the center . a faraday cage do use something similar , though ; you may have see someone stand inside a metal cage next to a van de graaff generator and touch the metal without get shock .	chucks86	1432914847	1	0

05_00298	t1_cqvd6eh	null	It makes sense to me. Twitter is for brief quasi-oneway contact which is perfect for the current generation, but if you look at the clientele of Facebook and other sites those are long bidirectional communication. You can't post a life event/story on Twitter most of the time, if you can sum it up in 140 characters it's not a life event. Facebook gives users more freedom then Twitter, that's what people are drawn to. It's the degree of expression you can have on Facebook vs Twitter. That's why I think it makes sense that Facebook's user base is bigger. Edit: Spelling Edit 2: Spelling once more!	it make sense to me . twitter be for brief quasi-oneway contact which be perfect for the current generation , but if you look at the clientele of facebook and other site those be long bidirectional communication . you ca n't post a life event/story on twitter most of the time , if you can sum it up in character it 's not a life event . facebook give user more freedom then twitter , that 's what people be draw to . it 's the degree of expression you can have on facebook v twitter . that 's why i think it make sense that facebook 's user base be big . edit : spelling edit : spell once more !

You'd probably start to feel warm down there, however.  If catching cancer is your goal and you intend to do it via ionizing radiation and you're in a hurry, I'd suggest breaking into your doctor's office and setting the X-ray machine to not turn itself off after a few seconds and spend a while basking in its glow.  A CT machine may be even better.  If you're not in a hurry, just spend lots and lots and lots of time sunbathing.	microwave oven do n't create ionize radiation , therefore they do n't cause cancer , even with the safety disable and the door open while they 're on and your junk ( doodle mean crotch/genitals , right ? ) be right near the door . you 'd probably start to feel warm down there , however . if catch cancer be your goal and you intend to do it via ionize radiation and you 're in a hurry , i 'd suggest break into your doctor 's office and set the x-ray machine to not turn itself off after a few second and spend a while basking in its glow . a ct machine may be even well . if you 're not in a hurry , just spend lot and lot and lot of time sunbathing .	dougmc	1430429374	0	0

Also further research in wikipedia shows that its illegal to own and trade in the U.S. as part of blanket laws against whale exploitation, despite ambergris trade not being a direct threat to the animal (allegedly).

It was about a family that is tormented by an alien (or aliens), who affects their minds and bodies psychically. The concept was then turned into a family story, but a few of the elements still remained, such as the concept of Elliot having a psychic bond with E.T.  A movie called Dark Skies was just released a few years ago about a family tormented by an alien. I'm sure the overall plot changed around a little, but it is definitely the original story for "Night Skies" that Spielberg intended for E.T.  Edit: messed up the original Spielberg title.	e.t . itself be originally conceive as a sci-fi horror film under the title `` night sky '' . it be about a family that be torment by an alien ( or alien ) , who affect their mind and body psychically . the concept be then turn into a family story , but a few of the element still remain , such as the concept of elliot have a psychic bond with e.t . a movie call dark sky be just release a few year ago about a family torment by an alien . i 'm sure the overall plot change around a little , but it be definitely the original story for `` night sky '' that spielberg intend for e.t . edit : mess up the original spielberg title .	faster_than_sound	1432053693	22	0

05_01044	t1_cqxerpf	t1_cqxebyc	I absolutely agree. There has been a big campaign in the military and DoD in gerenal to be more aware of sexual assault. Everything from prevention to respect for victims and taking investigations seriously.  The last thing you'd want to do to slow down the rate of sexual violence is downplay the job of women in the military. Telling people they aren't important to the organization doesn't foster a culture where they feel useful and helps perpetrators further dehumanize victims. If I went through the same training as you and we ended up at the same place doing the same job, there is no reason to not give me the same respect as any of your male colleges.  	i absolutely agree . there have be a big campaign in the military and dod in gerenal to be more aware of sexual assault . everything from prevention to respect for victim and take investigation seriously . the last thing you 'd want to do to slow down the rate of sexual violence be downplay the job of woman in the military . tell people they be n't important to the organization do n't foster a culture where they feel useful and help perpetrator far dehumanize victim . if i go through the same training as you and we end up at the same place do the same job , there be no reason to not give me the same respect as any of your male college .

In addition to nearly cutting his own leg off, Nugent made the contestants play chicken with the ranch truck, which promptly broke the first contestant's leg.  It was really hard to feel sorry for these people though, because they were so fucking stupid: they had to 'elect' a president among themselves, and then protect that person with their bodies, while being shot at by real Secret Service men firing paintball guns.  The height of the team members ranged from a 6'2" guy, to a miniscule, 5' woman.

I agree feminism wants men to no longer fulfill traditional gender roles because in doing so it tears down the patriarchy.  They want women to be the authority figure in society/family just as much as the man so removing men from that role is a good thing in their opinion.  However, at the same time, they want the financial and social security that comes with marriage.  They want to flip the tables and turn men into property.  They see men as alimony payouts or worker bees to act as reparations for years of female oppression.    So yes, they want men to be married (to extract their wealth), and they want them single because that tears down the patriarchy.	i think the conflict come from feminism not clearly know what it want . i agree feminism want men to no long fulfill traditional gender role because in do so it tear down the patriarchy . they want woman to be the authority figure in society/family just as much as the man so remove men from that role be a good thing in their opinion . however , at the same time , they want the financial and social security that come with marriage . they want to flip the table and turn men into property . they see men as alimony payouts or worker bee to act as reparation for year of female oppression . so yes , they want men to be marry ( to extract their wealth ) , and they want them single because that tear down the patriarchy .	banned_1_time	1431451373	1	0

The title of the study is " "Polar bear penis bone may be weakened by pollution".  "May" is an important word here.   Second, and probably more importantly, this Polar bear ED isn't caused by ongoing pollution.   It's caused by a very specific chemical (PCBs) that have been banned in most countries,in some since the 70's, IIRC.  So this has nothing to do with carbon emissions and the linked article isn't exactly clear on that.

05_10523	t1_crr070q	null	My wife has a family member that works as a sociologist for the Catholic Church in Washington, DC.  Fewer and fewer people want to join the clergy these days.  However, one of the bigger problems they're facing is that, in the US at least, more and more Catholic families are ignoring the no birth control rules.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that having lots of kids is expensive.  It's extremely difficult to raise 6 or 7 kids on $35-40k per year.  Since not many people convert to Catholicism, this reduction in births combined with the fact that non-belief amongst young people is rapidly growing means that within the next few decades, Catholicism will likely face a membership crisis.  Fewer Catholics = less tithing = budget shortfalls.	my wife have a family member that work as a sociologist for the catholic church in washington , dc . few and few people want to join the clergy these day . however , one of the big problem they 're face be that , in the u at least , more and more catholic family be ignore the no birth control rule . it do n't take a genius to figure out that have lot of kid be expensive . it 's extremely difficult to raise or kid on $ per year . since not many people convert to catholicism , this reduction in birth combine with the fact that non-belief amongst young people be rapidly grow mean that within the next few decade , catholicism will likely face a membership crisis . few catholic = less tithe = budget shortfall .

05_10523	t1_crr10cx	t1_crr070q	I feel like the birth control logic is so roundabout too. Basically since labor pains were punishment for original sin, therefore women can't inhibit themselves from having babies? That doesn't quite follow even in its own vacuum.  If labor pains are punishment for original sin then it doesn't necessarily follow that you must experience labor pains, and we can prove this by the large number of women who are naturally infertile. So, these women are made infertile by the hand of God, how are they exempt from original sin?   I think that the church will end up saying that, just like the rule about how priests can't have sex, they made this rule up and it is not based in scripture. 	i feel like the birth control logic be so roundabout too . basically since labor pain be punishment for original sin , therefore woman ca n't inhibit themselves from have baby ? that do n't quite follow even in its own vacuum . if labor pain be punishment for original sin then it do n't necessarily follow that you must experience labor pain , and we can prove this by the large number of woman who be naturally infertile . so , these woman be make infertile by the hand of god , how be they exempt from original sin ? i think that the church will end up say that , just like the rule about how priest ca n't have sex , they make this rule up and it be not base in scripture .

So I'm not making a claim that the conclusions from this test are wrong, but it sounds as though these tests took place in a small room rather than being played by one person, and judged by another person listening in a concert hall.

Now there is a suggested donation to compensate for your magazine order, but there is no way to track who is compensating and who isn't.   They changed the policy because there was a televangelist who was selling books and the IRS won a court case against him because they successfully argued that selling books and merchandise isn't an act of religious worship and thus can be taxed. Rather than be taxed, the Watchtower opted to give out all literature "free of charge" but they also heavily encourage members to ask for voluntary donations at the door.	i grow up jw . you have n't have to buy the magazine for a long time , now . they stop that in the early 's . now there be a suggested donation to compensate for your magazine order , but there be no way to track who be compensate and who be n't . they change the policy because there be a televangelist who be sell book and the irs win a court case against him because they successfully argue that sell book and merchandise be n't an act of religious worship and thus can be tax . rather than be tax , the watchtower opt to give out all literature `` free of charge '' but they also heavily encourage member to ask for voluntary donation at the door .

However, as global temperatures rise, the amount of CO2 that is dissolvable in ocean water decreases and so some of the CO2 that is being held onto is released into this atmosphere. This only adds to the positive feedback loop of global warming.	one of the bad thing be that the ocean hold around time more than the atmosphere . normally , this be great as they act as a large carbon dioxide `` sink .

Plenty of people own cars and don't get in wrecks every single day. Plenty of people that owns these cars also get in wrecks every single day. Everyone didn't stop getting in car accidents once speed limits on roadways were introduced and popularized. What makes everyone think people are going to stop getting murdered just because we impose preventative restrictions on gun ownership?

Jubilee has a seizure playing Virtua Fighter, but is saved from mall security by Emma Frost and Banshee.  She is brought to their school where a bunch of angsty teenage mutants bicker.  Cue 1 hour of bickering, horny mutants.  One Tree Hill with sucky super-powers and lots of female empowerment.  When the gang goes to a carnival (yes, a crappy, county carnival) the  Big Bad finally makes his move, kidnaps the super-teen with the lamest power and threatens to drill into his brain, until the super brat pack learns a lesson about the value of teamwork.

This is in Bangladesh so we can get these things quite cheap. Specialty lens and Brand name frames and lenses definitely cost a lot more obviously.   Even adjusting for the cost of business in America, basic glasses should cost much less than what it does in America.   My lenses and frame are both probably Chinese or Indian and they work fine.      The point I am trying to make is, just like health care, Americans have been cheated by businessmen for decades who have manufactured  a market where outrageous profit is the norm.	eye glass for the most part be very cheap . the last one be bougt cost $ for the frame and $ for the lens . this be in bangladesh so we can get these thing quite cheap . specialty lens and brand name frame and lenses definitely cost a lot more obviously . even adjust for the cost of business in america , basic glass should cost much less than what it do in america . my lens and frame be both probably chinese or indian and they work fine . the point i be try to make be , just like health care , american have be cheat by businessmen for decade who have manufacture a market where outrageous profit be the norm .

Unlike George I don't lie all of the time, but I find it hard to not find someone who isn't too controlling or demanding.	i actually think the same thing lol . i 'm a nerdy , thin a rail , bastard with bad teeth . george and i have something in common and that we be both likeable . there be people out there that be attract to the opposite of the alpha male and want someone that will be more likely to empathize with them and someone they feel they can care for . it work . unlike george i do n't lie all of the time , but i find it hard to not find someone who be n't too control or demand .	ztfreeman	1430598207	0	0

A complete Dyson sphere simply isn't credible as a practical project.  There isn't enough material around a star to build one (so now you're into interstellar shipping of multiple planetary masses!), and even if you had the material there's no way to build a solid shell around a star.  Physics won't permit it.  You're far more likely to see some kind of spinning belt, probably of discrete satellites rather than one continuous ribbon.

Update: ok, so pronated deadlifts (both overhand) is the only exercise I know of that grip strength is the limiting factor on. I started off establishing my one rep max with all 5 fingers as between 335-345. I then tried an easy 185 4 fingered lift - no prob. 225 - no prob. I went all the way up to 275 and it was a little tough at that point, but I had been using my grip the entire time so I estimate my one rep max with 4 fingers as 295. In other words, I call bullshit.

05_01681	t1_cqz96y2	t1_cqz73wp	The Catholic Church has had differing opinions on the 10 Commandments over the 2,000+ years it's been around.  And the importance of the different commandments has changed.  During the Middle Ages when property rights and inheritance were very important then adultery was much more important that it is today.  And while the 10 Commandments also banned idolatry the Church lightened up on that a long time ago.  As for praying to Mary or the saints, it's not considered blasphemous b/c we aren't worshiping them.  Its more like we're praying to them to "put in a good word" for us b/c they're more proximate to God than we are.  This is 18 years of Catholic school: grade school through grad school.	the catholic church have have differ opinion on the commandment over the year it 's be around . and the importance of the different commandment have change . during the middle age when property right and inheritance be very important then adultery be much more important that it be today . and while the commandment also ban idolatry the church lighten up on that a long time ago . as for pray to mary or the saint , it 's not consider blasphemous b/c we be n't worship them . its more like we 're pray to them to `` put in a good word '' for us b/c they 're more proximate to god than we be . this be year of catholic school : grade school through grad school .	nilok1	1430845772	2	0

05_07339	t1_crgwc65	null	Recently there was an article about a common microbe that produces a byproduct that kills white nose syndrome.  They're working on isolating the specific compound and are excited because it's something that may be applicable in an aerosol form.  I'm on mobile right now and can't post the link.  At a conference I attended last month several of the bat experts said there is a slight lessening of white nose syndrome deaths as the remaining bat population may be developing a resistance to it.  Unfortunately, it's only a slight lessening though.	recently there be an article about a common microbe that produce a byproduct that kill white nose syndrome . they 're work on isolate the specific compound and be excite because it 's something that may be applicable in an aerosol form . i 'm on mobile right now and ca n't post the link . at a conference i attend last month several of the bat expert say there be a slight lessening of white nose syndrome death as the remain bat population may be develop a resistance to it . unfortunately , it 's only a slight lessening though .	7LeagueBoots	1432250794	2	0
05_07339	t1_crjtg09	t1_crgwc65	I've worked on WNS as a biologist - I am also familiar with the compound you are talking about. It's a Volatile Organic Compound from a bacterial species of Rhodococcus - and they've also had some promising work showing results using the VOC to treat chalkbrood disease in honeybees.   I don't think, however, the bats are becoming resistant to the fungus. Because the populations are so low, the fungus can't spread as readily. In large colonies of bats, the fungus can spread like gangbusters - but it's definitely going to slow down if there are less bats. Basically, what it has done is significantly reduced the carrying capacity for bat populations - Pds will now work as a control, keeping the bat colonies from ever growing to the sizes they once were.  	i 've work on wns as a biologist - i be also familiar with the compound you be talk about . it 's a volatile organic compound from a bacterial specie of rhodococcus - and they 've also have some promising work show result use the voc to treat chalkbrood disease in honeybee . i do n't think , however , the bat be become resistant to the fungus . because the population be so low , the fungus ca n't spread as readily . in large colony of bat , the fungus can spread like gangbusters - but it 's definitely go to slow down if there be less bat . basically , what it have do be significantly reduce the carrying capacity for bat population - pd will now work as a control , keep the bat colony from ever grow to the size they once be .

Do employers mind? Not really. Do I mind? Not really. Why?

You always have a choice to rape, murder, and rob others yes? Yes, the answer is yes. As individuals, we are more than our race and where we grew up. We choose how to live our lives and that has a direct impact on our friends and families.  Want to know why crime exists so much for some and not others? Because individuals made choices to be criminals without any care or respect for their fellow man or neighbor.  Now reddit, are you going to make excuses for these individuals? Shall we continue to ignore individual responsibility so that we can push our feel good agendas?

Of course these people are at fault for failing to control themselfes, but you know who is also at fault? The society that failed them.           And before you call me names, im not from the US. In my country we try to rehabilitate all criminals. We don't do death penalty, or even real life sentences. Its because if you treat people, even criminals, with respect and open them some options to not be criminals, the vast majority of them will take these gladly.	individual responsibility be only part of what can stop a person from commit a crime . socio-economic factor and income play a big role . of course these people be at fault for fail to control themselfes , but you know who be also at fault ? the society that fail them . and before you call me names , im not from the u . in my country we try to rehabilitate all criminal . we do n't do death penalty , or even real life sentence . its because if you treat people , even criminal , with respect and open them some option to not be criminal , the vast majority of them will take these gladly .

Pixar's strength, and what has made them a household name in a relatively short span of time, is that they don't assume kids can't comprehend certain real-world complexities. No matter how fantastic a Pixar movie's setting is, at the core of the narrative are themes that both adults and children can relate to. Maybe not on an equal level, but just because kids lack an adult perspective, that doesn't mean they can't find something meaningful in stories with "mature" themes. 	the problem with most kid movie be that they talk down to child , assume that they 're simplistic and stupid , and everything from the story to the character ultimately reflect the same saccharine narrative that have be tell a thousand time before . pixar 's strength , and what have make them a household name in a relatively short span of time , be that they do n't assume kid ca n't comprehend certain real-world complexity . no matter how fantastic a pixar movie 's setting be , at the core of the narrative be theme that both adult and child can relate to . maybe not on an equal level , but just because kid lack an adult perspective , that do n't mean they ca n't find something meaningful in story with `` mature '' theme .	dangerous_beans	1432961863	45	0

The gravity interactions of the earth and the moon are conservative because if the earth slowed it would speed up the moon and the total energy and momentum would be unchanged.

I assume you also advocate chopping off the hands of accused thieves, slicing the genitals of alleged sex offenders, killing a DUI driver if he/she has killed someone else?   Let me be absolutely clear, I am not defending poachers in any way, shape or form, I think they should be jailed for untold years.  However, KILLING people who may or may not know (it doesn't matter) if they use Rhino horn in something is not right, there is no justification for it at all. Not only that but you want them to die "horribly agonizing".  Arrest and jail, prevention,  yes, murder.. no. 	ah the old animal be more important than people routine . i assume you also advocate chop off the hand of accused thief , slice the genitals of alleged sex offender , kill a duo driver if he/she have kill someone else ? let me be absolutely clear , i be not defend poacher in any way , shape or form , i think they should be jail for untold year . however , killing people who may or may not know ( it do n't matter ) if they use rhino horn in something be not right , there be no justification for it at all . not only that but you want them to die `` horribly agonize '' . arrest and jail , prevention , yes , murder.. no .	lostintransactions	1432408509	1	0

The tool itself was just a little rubber bladder, slightly larger than an egg, and through long practise he was adept at keeping it completely hidden in his hand.  I've got a pretty good poker face myself, but it is nothing compared to his vast, blank stare. The reactions of the other guests, mostly wealthy and elderly, when he used it in the elevator (sometimes two or three times in a trip) was too precious; a couple of times I nearly peed myself on the way down to the lobby. The ~~orientals~~ Asians tended to be especially scandalized. 	work with him in vancouver , where the production have put him in the swanky , most expensive apartment hotel in town . the tool itself be just a little rubber bladder , slightly large than an egg , and through long practise he be adept at keep it completely hidden in his hand . i 've get a pretty good poker face myself , but it be nothing compare to his vast , blank stare . the reaction of the other guest , mostly wealthy and elderly , when he use it in the elevator ( sometimes two or three time in a trip ) be too precious ; a couple of time i nearly pee myself on the way down to the lobby . the ~~orientals~~ asian tend to be especially scandalize .	theartfulcodger	1432665810	35	0

Basically black licorice contains a compound called glycyrrhizic acid that mimics aldosterone, a hormone our body secretes to retain fluid. Aldosterone also causes potassium excretion so too much black licorice = potassium depletion = loss of muscle function, including heart muscles = heart failure.

It can be a very bewildering experience at times, imagine staring into a person's vagina through a speculum or having your finger in a man's anal cavity all the while they are trying to teach you about human anatomy. Not something you'll see in any other field. On the contrary though, it is not as awkward as it seems as it is a very professional environment and they are very knowledgeable and excellent educators.

Now you don't see ashtrays anymore, they don't exist in cars and people all do it outside and think they can just throw it away.

Over the last 5 year people have been cherry picking their pet idea and using that t explain the statistical illusion that cats survive more from greater heights.  And this overlooks the many time a cat sneaks out, gets down stairs and the owners assume the fell.  Or when that hop down a ledge at a time.

The rules as stated are disadvantageous to the Host, while we are trained to be suspicious of the Host in such contests (and with good reason). So, when the Host offers the chance to *switch*, we will on some level assume it is a set-up. We tend to ignore the literal rules and think we are missing something that makes this a bad idea.  That's not entirely why people have so much trouble with the problem of course nor even a big part.
