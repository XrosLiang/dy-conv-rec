In my industry, everyone uses a Mac, but they don't rave about it, they can't upgrade the RAM, the SSD or anything, on their own computer. It's a joke.  When you buy one, you know it's not worth the money and that there are other laptops out there for the same price with better specs, or the same specs with a cheaper price tag, but you have no choice.   I reckon Hackintosh is the way to go with a home setup and then a Apple product if you need OSX on the move, otherwise a Chromebook with Linux or Windows laptop would do.	apple be just disaapointing , they pander to the people who do n't know what they want from a computer , and will prioritise look . in my industry , everyone use a mac , but they do n't rave about it , they ca n't upgrade the ram , the ssd or anything , on their own computer . it 's a joke . when you buy one , you know it 's not worth the money and that there be other laptop out there for the same price with good spec , or the same spec with a cheap price tag , but you have no choice . i reckon hackintosh be the way to go with a home setup and then a apple product if you need osx on the move , otherwise a chromebook with linux or window laptop would do .

They accept donations and will be crowd-funding for the final push before market.  As other people pointed out trials need to be done in the US before this can go to market. Reasons why they haven't already been done are many but mostly due to a perceived or real lack of market, though now I think there clearly is a market for men in 2015 though there may not have been in the past, and the fact that the treatment is for the most part very cheap meaning that potential profit is relatively low though the cost for trials is high. 	vasalgel be work it 's way through trial ! baboon trial be ongoing and human trial should be start in . they accept donation and will be crowd-funding for the final push before market . as other people point out trial need to be do in the u before this can go to market . reason why they have n't already be do be many but mostly due to a perceive or real lack of market , though now i think there clearly be a market for men in though there may not have be in the past , and the fact that the treatment be for the most part very cheap meaning that potential profit be relatively low though the cost for trial be high .	durable	1427992570	9	0

I swear, it's like reddit is so determined to make US out to be a dystopian, Orwellian, evil empire that facts have flown right out the fucking window.	thank you . this have nothing to do with snowden . the eo basically say that if you materially contribute to people or group that launch cyberattacks against the u , your asset can be seize or freeze - that have be the case for contribute to terrorist organization for a long time , and this eo just put cyberterrorism in the same basket . i swear , it 's like reddit be so determined to make us out to be a dystopian , orwellian , evil empire that fact have fly right out the fucking window .	jeffly777	1428072108	5	0

As much as it makes me uncomfortable, I can't think of a good alternative when good evidence shows that assets in the US are being used to fund terrorism of criminal activities.  That's why just about every nation on earth does it, many with much less oversight than in the US.  There should be more oversight here, but that's really my only idea for making this stuff more palatable.  If you have any ideas, please share.	i do n't like the idea of pre-process asset seizure at all , but it 's an unfortunate part of life in the modern world . as much as it make me uncomfortable , i ca n't think of a good alternative when good evidence show that asset in the u be be use to fund terrorism of criminal activity . that 's why just about every nation on earth do it , many with much less oversight than in the u . there should be more oversight here , but that 's really my only idea for make this stuff more palatable . if you have any idea , please share .	jeffly777	1428075039	1	0

The more telling number is "fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled". This number has been going down consistently for the past 100 years due to better passive and active safety systems. You are now half as likely to die driving your car than you were in 1988. The future of continuing to get this number down relies on active safety systems, actually avoiding the accident in the first place. Things like radar-equipped cars that have emergency collision avoidance/braking. It's an exciting time for auto safety systems.

I couldn't even drive to go skiing or the beach or a city with that range, and I'm in a decent sized city, not far from NYC or Philly, but electric just can't reasonably get there.  Based on the article, right now a 300 mile range leaf would cost about $30,000 in batteries alone, so probably closer to 60k total. At the near future $230/kwh battery you're looking at $23,000 for batteries. We need to see the price cut down to less than 1/3 what it is now to really be viable, more likely 1/6 or less though. Then that $30,000 battery pack would only be 5k, which is pricey, but not unattainable, and is even replaceable every 10-20 years reasonably as needed.	my feeling exactly , the nissan leaf for have at best mile of range . i could n't even drive to go skiing or the beach or a city with that range , and i 'm in a decent sized city , not far from nyc or philly , but electric just ca n't reasonably get there . base on the article , right now a mile range leaf would cost about $ in battery alone , so probably close to total . at the near future $ battery you 're look at $ for battery . we need to see the price cut down to less than what it be now to really be viable , more likely or less though . then that $ battery pack would only be , which be pricey , but not unattainable , and be even replaceable every year reasonably as need .	ben7337	1428384508	2	0

Many (probably *most*) convicts in the US will have committed minor crimes. Why should someone who shoplifted once, 20 years ago be considered in the slightest bit dangerous? It's really no wonder there are so many homeless Americans and so much crime, given that one conviction over a minor incident can prevent you getting hired, even for a *construction* job.  That, and construction isn't just "one person to each task" - everything is evaluated meticulously by engineers and the like (or should be, and I'm sure with Apple, it will be).	that argument only apply to convict who have be nab relatively recently , or who have commit serious crime . many ( probably *most* ) convict in the u will have commit minor crime . why should someone who shoplift once , year ago be consider in the slight bit dangerous ? it 's really no wonder there be so many homeless american and so much crime , give that one conviction over a minor incident can prevent you get hire , even for a *construction* job . that , and construction be n't just `` one person to each task '' - everything be evaluate meticulously by engineer and the like ( or should be , and i 'm sure with apple , it will be ) .	semiorthodoxjew	1428415624	2	0

Most of the time they "only" manage 30-40 because my older CPU and Intel 530 SSD are unable to keep up with expanding and writing the game files.  Now that's still fast as heck but a 300Mbit DOCSIS 3.0 link would be just as good.  The really amazing thing about gigabit is the upload speed allows for maximum cat photo sharing without affecting the download speeds.  With my cable connection it was easy to max out the upload and when that happened download speeds would crater as well.	i have gibabit and steam download seem to top out at around ( so ) . most of the time they `` only '' manage because my old cpu and intel ssd be unable to keep up with expand and write the game file . now that 's still fast as heck but a docsis link would be just as good . the really amazing thing about gigabit be the upload speed allow for maximum cat photo share without affect the download speed . with my cable connection it be easy to max out the upload and when that happen download speed would crater as well .

The average number of occupants is around 75-100 per house and because they are 18-22 year olds, they are on Netflix, Pandora and Spotify almost constantly.  The best mitigation technique we've had so far is to split the house up into zones that each has their own 100Mbps Comcast line.  We also run Untangle computers as the routers so that they have beefy enough hardware not to crap out on us.

That would just make things worse, if one section was at 100%, and another section was at 75%, or something?  There has to be some way to get multi-homing to work.	the scary thing be that that 's pretty much the same problem cell phone company have with cell phone tower . how many cell phone stream a youtube video , or something else like that can one cell phone tower in new york handle ? but why would you split up the house ? that would just make thing bad , if one section be at % , and another section be at % , or something ? there have to be some way to get multi-homing to work .	cp5184	1428443889	1	0

So we set up multiple networks with separate SSIDs based on the zones of the house so that they know to connect to the one in their area for the best signal.  Budget wise I can usually get the houses to spring for the nice, commercial access points but not the WLAN controller to keep the whole thing together.  Plus, it's not bad having all of those boxes separate since it allows me to have failovers if something up and dies.  I'm definitely open to suggestions though on better architectures. 	well , % of the user be on wi-fi because they ca n't be bother to plug in an ethernet cable . so we set up multiple network with separate ssids base on the zone of the house so that they know to connect to the one in their area for the best signal . budget wise i can usually get the house to spring for the nice , commercial access point but not the wlan controller to keep the whole thing together . plus , it 's not bad have all of those box separate since it allow me to have failovers if something up and dy . i 'm definitely open to suggestion though on good architecture .

On February 1, 1994, the company filed its application with the following description: "The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use." Nine of Harley Davidson's competitors filed oppositions against the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin V-twin engine which produces the same sound. After six years of litigation, with no end in sight, in early 2000, Harley-Davidson withdrew their application.	relevant text : more famously , harley-davidson attempt to register as a trademark the distinctive `` chug '' of a harley-davidson motorcycle engine . on february , , the company file its application with the following description : `` the mark consist of the exhaust sound of applicant 's motorcycle , produce by v-twin , common crankpin motorcycle engine when the good be in use .

You pay back the loan by feeding back into the system which should take about 7 years so essentially it pays for itself.

And if one is that concerned about running chrome vs chromium, they would /should also be running a better operating system with a much more open ecosystem to begin with, and you get that stuff out of the box.   Right though , the other major browsers are closed.. Although opera is directly using Blink. In fact, the very minority of browsers are open source, unfortunately...   Although on android, there's no version of chromium on the app store.. I'm not certain if it's mainlined to chromium or entirely separate..

But that's expected considering it's not even version 1.0.  I'd also like to see a much more intuitive interface for unblocking certain elements. I don't understand what all the pluses and minuses mean there. It would be better if it would be marked what's allowed with a green icon and with red what isn't.  I've heard 2 of the main developers (including its creator) left the project. But I assume something as popular as uBlock already has a big enough community to support its future development.  	ublock be definitely the best out there now . however , i sometimes have issue with it , and i have to press unblock on certain page . so they still need to work on the kink . but that 's expect consider it 's not even version . i 'd also like to see a much more intuitive interface for unblock certain element . i do n't understand what all the plus and minus mean there . it would be good if it would be mark what 's allow with a green icon and with red what be n't . i 've hear of the main developer ( include its creator ) leave the project . but i assume something as popular as ublock already have a big enough community to support its future development .	johnmountain	1428905050	19	0

However, by adding another annual fee of $200, collecting just ~20% of that tax would be sufficient to account for the foregone gas tax; the other 80% is totally unnecessary.

They are undeniably services, and it makes sense to refer to them as being cloud-based not only to distinguish from a locally-run alternative but because in most cases you wouldn't be connecting to a single external server but a service that manages disparate nodes (usually different engines run on donated hardware time around the world) and so ostensibly does not exist in one physical location.

Drop a little more cash for some 32 core server with a bijillion GBs of RAM and you're in much better shape. You can then put that engine on a private webpage, input the board, click the button and the server will crunch out a *list* of moves with estimated scores at really good search depth. Not one move, not two. You can get a bunch of them. That five minutes on the toilet can easily translate into spotting tactics that even high level chess players will miss.	deep blue be weak . you can hit extreme search depth in just a minute or two with an ordinary desktop computer . drop a little more cash for some core server with a bijillion gb of ram and you 're in much good shape . you can then put that engine on a private webpage , input the board , click the button and the server will crunch out a *list* of move with estimated score at really good search depth . not one move , not two . you can get a bunch of them . that five minute on the toilet can easily translate into spot tactic that even high level chess player will miss .

04_01226	t1_cqemyy5	t1_cqej0xm	Because it's very expensive. Running it to your driveway means one run for an entire block is enough. Running into each home with fiber means they have to dig up each homes driveway/yard and physically bring one additional run into each home.  Yes, getting it into each home is better but it costs a lot more and requires them to talk to every single home owner individually. Running only to the drive way still allows them to run fiber into the home later, it's a first step that has to happen either way.  All new homes in my city are already wired with fiber. In fact nobody here has run copper lines in years but there's still tons of existing copper in place and changing it all is a huge task.	because it 's very expensive . run it to your driveway mean one run for an entire block be enough . run into each home with fiber mean they have to dig up each home driveway/yard and physically bring one additional run into each home . yes , get it into each home be well but it cost a lot more and require them to talk to every single home owner individually . run only to the drive way still allow them to run fiber into the home later , it 's a first step that have to happen either way . all new home in my city be already wire with fiber . in fact nobody here have run copper line in year but there 's still ton of exist copper in place and change it all be a huge task .

04_01226	t1_cqfaxuy	t1_cqf5yts	Funny, you know more than me, a telecommunications engineer.  PON is much cheaper.  It's not the fiber cable that's expensive. Fiber cable is ultra cheap, specially compared to copper, which is one of the most expensive metals you can buy (right after silver).  In fiber, what really makes it expensive is the equipment besides the cables, but those have been getting cheaper and cheaper and specially with PON, now with that we can do high performance mono-mode networks, using DWDM. And ONT's are cheap too. And networks can support very large number of users.  Seriously, it's an one way trip to fiber.  Look at top countries in internet speed in Europe. All of them have cheap service fees and heavily dependent on Fiber networks.	funny , you know more than me , a telecommunication engineer . pon be much cheap . it 's not the fiber cable that 's expensive . fiber cable be ultra cheap , specially compare to copper , which be one of the most expensive metal you can buy ( right after silver ) . in fiber , what really make it expensive be the equipment besides the cable , but those have be get cheap and cheap and specially with pon , now with that we can do high performance mono-mode network , use dwdm . and ont 's be cheap too . and network can support very large number of user . seriously , it 's an one way trip to fiber . look at top country in internet speed in europe . all of them have cheap service fee and heavily dependent on fiber network .

04_01226	t1_cqfmw9k	t1_cqfaxuy	This isn't about laying copper vs fiber. This is about not laying fibre and just using existing copper. Laying new fibre could be considered cheap compared to laying new copper but the whole point is you lay absolutely zero copper and only one main fiber line. The main cost isn't the fiber either, it's the actual work needed to lay new lines.  Your way simply isn't cheaper and yes I have worked on this myself, I don't care if you are a telecommunications engineer or not what you're suggesting is more work as you have to work on each residence with your method.	this be n't about lay copper v fiber . this be about not lay fibre and just use exist copper . lay new fibre could be consider cheap compare to lay new copper but the whole point be you lay absolutely zero copper and only one main fiber line . the main cost be n't the fiber either , it 's the actual work need to lay new line . your way simply be n't cheap and yes i have work on this myself , i do n't care if you be a telecommunication engineer or not what you 're suggest be more work as you have to work on each residence with your method .

Anyway, i think that it is silly to depend on a device like a car or a tv for this functionality. i laughed my ass off when apple switched to the lightning connector and all those cars and bose radios became deprecated.   For a tv you should use a well supported, very cheap device, like a roku, or cromecast. if you are a power-user then you should also have a server with things to watch or a HTPC hooked up.	so what be you suppose to do if some manufacturer do n't give good support . many/most device never get a firmware update after they be replace by a new model . anyway , i think that it be silly to depend on a device like a car or a tv for this functionality . i laugh my as off when apple switch to the lightning connector and all those car and bose radio become deprecated . for a tv you should use a well support , very cheap device , like a roku , or cromecast . if you be a power-user then you should also have a server with thing to watch or a htpc hook up .	peacegnome	1429648022	3	0

Frankly they're amazing bulbs; when lit they look like a normal incandescent, perhaps, a bit cooler in color. There isn't a bulky heat sink which is presumably where the cost savings comes in and why they are so cheap.

Normally you don't want it to be possible to turn the car off while it's moving. In fact, I think it was GM that had some crappy ignition switches that could turn off because of weight hanging off the key and I'm pretty sure even that caused some fatal accidents. Being able to bump the button on a push to start and have the car die while it wasn't parked would be pretty dangerous.	it 's just like a computer , in an emergency , hold the button in for a few second to kill it . normally you do n't want it to be possible to turn the car off while it 's move . in fact , i think it be gm that have some crappy ignition switch that could turn off because of weight hang off the key and i 'm pretty sure even that cause some fatal accident . be able to bump the button on a push to start and have the car die while it be n't park would be pretty dangerous .

04_01913	t1_cqprag9	t1_cqpqni9	There's a reason they don't use aluminum bats in MLB - they explode when hit too hard. Metals are an inherently crystalline structure. While ductility is a property of metals impacts do shatter it. Some metals are better than others, aluminum is one of the worst.  If you watch the ALON videos, you will see the aluminum shatter, but it lasts long enough to disperse the force over a larger area. The polycarbobate provides tensile strength to amplify the effect over successive layers.	there 's a reason they do n't use aluminum bat in mlb - they explode when hit too hard . metal be an inherently crystalline structure . while ductility be a property of metal impact do shatter it . some metal be good than others , aluminum be one of the bad . if you watch the alon video , you will see the aluminum shatter , but it last long enough to disperse the force over a large area . the polycarbobate provide tensile strength to amplify the effect over successive layer .	loteknik	1430096527	4	0

MLB does in fact hold that the speed of the ball coming off aluminium is dangerous to the pitcher. They didn't say anything about the offensive advantage, but I suspect that was also a major consideration in their decision.

Also, locomotives and their traction-motors are a little different than the conventional hybrids. They've got bigass powerful diesel engines turning a generator. The generator itself provides current relatively directly to the motors when you need to throttle up the engine and go faster/pull harder.   They don't bother with storing the energy in batteries. Probably because of the massive amount of power required. There was a hybrid-demonstrator built years ago.  Called the green-goat I think. They used it in switching yards for moving around cars. Worked on battery power for a portion of the time. Engine would turn on as required.	motor def be n't the issue . energy storage be . that 's why liquid fuel be so nice . concentrated , easily store , easily dispense , and easily liberate energy . also , locomotive and their traction-motors be a little different than the conventional hybrid . they 've get bigass powerful diesel engine turn a generator . the generator itself provide current relatively directly to the motor when you need to throttle up the engine and go faster/pull harder . they do n't bother with store the energy in battery . probably because of the massive amount of power require . there be a hybrid-demonstrator built year ago . call the green-goat i think . they use it in switch yard for move around car . work on battery power for a portion of the time . engine would turn on as require .	molrobocop	1430156259	1	0

Individual rail companies will never pony up the cash because the ROI is too low and the payback period is 25+ years which is longer than any CEO term.

So difference would be without steam, he can double click and launch civ5. With Steam, he has to HAVE steam to play the game, open it up, log in, roll his eyes at the adds, then click on the Library tab and launch the game.   I don't see that DRM as being intrusive (having dealt with some of the other, way worse DRM measures), but if its for a single game, i can see how its not exactly convenient. 	in his defense , if be the only thing you have and use steam for , then its possible that he ( dont actually know their gender , but will assume male ) doesnt have steam auto-launching , and auto-sign in . so difference would be without steam , he can double click and launch . with steam , he have to have steam to play the game , open it up , log in , roll his eye at the add , then click on the library tab and launch the game . i do n't see that drm as be intrusive ( have deal with some of the other , way bad drm measure ) , but if its for a single game , i can see how its not exactly convenient .

Then someone managed to hack the BIOS to run on non-IBM computers (which IBM sued but lost), giving rise to Compaq, HP, and other IBM clones, leading to IBM's decline in the personal computer space.  Also I think the big difference is that Apple sells both the hardware and software. PC manufacturers suffer since they have to compete primarily in hardware (which is becoming /already commoditized).

Or, a pay what you want feature, or donation feature. But no set price content with a "piracy is legal" sidenote. That makes zero sense and will never happen.   It would defeat the purpose of having set prices for any entertainment, because no one would pay for content, and simply load up their now legal free netflix apps.

Even then, a single corporation might own hundreds or thousands of popular brands in just as many markets, not all of which are clearly advertised as such.  Their factories also might produce other brands of similar products in contract with their owners.  The boycott pretty much dies outside of consumer products.  You have no control over what brand of router your ISP buys, what brand of tires go on a truck delivering shit to you, or what concrete manufacturer supplies the concrete for your city's road improvements.  Furthermore, it would be unethical for anyone entrusted with purchasing for a business to choose a more expensive option for personal reasons.	good luck with that . the only thing you can ever effectively boycott be consumer product . even then , a single corporation might own hundred or thousand of popular brand in just as many market , not all of which be clearly advertise as such . their factory also might produce other brand of similar product in contract with their owner . the boycott pretty much dy outside of consumer product . you have no control over what brand of router your isp buy , what brand of tire go on a truck deliver shit to you , or what concrete manufacturer supply the concrete for your city 's road improvement . furthermore , it would be unethical for anyone entrust with purchasing for a business to choose a more expensive option for personal reason .

Please explain why that is unnecessary when, if the goal of any peering agreement to a network operator that is not already at the top of the food chain is to obtain a settlement free agreement, ISPs require equivalent ingress and egress metrics, and then proceed to never ever sell a symmetrical connection to any non-peering related customer.  Level 3 did an excellent job of calling Verizon out on their bullshit, and then Verizon responded by making all of their connection symmetrical. But the bullshit continues throughout the industry. These kinds of double standards and fuckery are commonplace. If you don't think that regulation—given the status of broadband monopolies—is completely warranted and appropriate, all things considered... I humbly challenge you to come up with a better solution.	okay . please explain why that be unnecessary when , if the goal of any peering agreement to a network operator that be not already at the top of the food chain be to obtain a settlement free agreement , isps require equivalent ingres and egress metric , and then proceed to never ever sell a symmetrical connection to any non-peering related customer . level do an excellent job of call verizon out on their bullshit , and then verizon respond by make all of their connection symmetrical . but the bullshit continue throughout the industry . these kind of double standard and fuckery be commonplace . if you do n't think that regulation—given the status of broadband monopolies—is completely warrant and appropriate , all thing consider ... i humbly challenge you to come up with a good solution .

Windows has made it so that a dev or two can tap into the Windows market with a day of work, max. Few devs would spend days or weeks creating an app for android, and not port it over to Windows. All Microsoft needs to do is get the ball rolling.

The Android tooling is more extensive and includes a runtime, so you can run Android apps without recompiling them.  There will be limitations with each, but overall it's a good strategy to get apps ported more rapidly.  Cross-plat is fine for many types of apps, and it's essentially what many devs are doing today for iOS and Android.  Other apps will want/need to leverage the underlying platform fully and thus would be built as universal apps.  This would also open them for use in Xbox as well as HoloLens and Continuum for Phone.	there be two distinct project ; the io tooling allow you to reuse objective-c code and recompile it to target window . the android tooling be more extensive and include a runtime , so you can run android apps without recompiling them . there will be limitation with each , but overall it 's a good strategy to get apps port more rapidly . cross-plat be fine for many type of apps , and it 's essentially what many devs be do today for io and android . other apps will want/need to leverage the underlying platform fully and thus would be build as universal apps . this would also open them for use in xbox as well as hololens and continuum for phone .	rocorey	1430417152	3	0

When we sold our home we included speed tests from the modem and each switch as part of our book.  I guess as an IT guy I wouldn't consider a home that didn't have guaranteed 20mb and have that written into my contract.  At that point then I'd sue the seller for the money to get it installed.

The homeowner would likely not have the expertise to guarantee that information and would have relied on the expert who in this case would have been lying.

We are getting to possible theoretical advantages rather than more definite ones, as neither the EM drive nor nuclear rockets that jettison spent fuel have actually been built and put to practical use.  One advantage with the electrical route is having the reactor support other processes which are not propulsion. Making an electrical propulsion system allows for a more versatile and modular design, with the possibility of redirecting power to different systems in the space ship.  Keeping spent fuel may also be more environmentally friendly too, but this would be more of an issue with the products of uranium and thorium reactions.  Perhaps both methods could be used together.	i see what you mean there . we be get to possible theoretical advantage rather than more definite one , as neither the em drive nor nuclear rocket that jettison spend fuel have actually be build and put to practical use . one advantage with the electrical route be have the reactor support other process which be not propulsion . make an electrical propulsion system allow for a more versatile and modular design , with the possibility of redirect power to different system in the space ship . keep spent fuel may also be more environmentally friendly too , but this would be more of an issue with the product of uranium and thorium reaction . perhaps both method could be use together .	jsgui	1430430847	1	0
