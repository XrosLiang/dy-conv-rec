Popped the disk in, found a bunch of late 90s porn and a Word document. It was filled with a bunch of "Dear Penthouse" type letters, obviously written by the former owner. They were mostly fantasies involving his wife getting railed by various other men.   We also found a catalog for those sex toy parties above the kitchen cabinets, and (what I assumed were) sex swing marks on a beam above the bed in the master bedroom.	we buy a house a few year ago . in the basement drop ceiling i find a zip disk . have to ask around a lot before i find someone with a zip drive . pop the disk in , find a bunch of late porn and a word document . it be fill with a bunch of `` dear penthouse '' type letter , obviously write by the former owner . they be mostly fantasy involve his wife get rail by various other men . we also find a catalog for those sex toy party above the kitchen cabinet , and ( what i assume be ) sex swing mark on a beam above the bed in the master bedroom .	normous	1430742108	10	0

If you translate what THEY call it directly, though, it's "Excite" and "Breakers" (Breakers being the waves that crash into the shore, I think). This makes more sense than our name, to be honest. "Mountain Dew" sounds like a calming tea, rather than the action-packed explosive sugar drink it's marketed as.	good , it be the name of the drink , what we call `` mountain dew '' . if you translate what they call it directly , though , it 's `` excite '' and `` breaker '' ( breaker be the wave that crash into the shore , i think ) . this make more sense than our name , to be honest . `` mountain dew '' sound like a calming tea , rather than the action-packed explosive sugar drink it 's market as .

05_02495	t1_cqzfkd4	null	This is about the fight only - not his domestic abuse charges.  Mayweather is an unbelievable boxer. Pac is considered the second best fighter in the world and he could not hit Mayweather. A professional boxer had 12 rounds to beat up Floyd but could not touch him.   Floyd is a defensive tactician and he proved that again. Pac hit him wiht 19% accuracy, the same as everyone else Floyd fights.   Why did Pac not throw more punches (800 rather than the 400 he threw). If you only connect 19% of the time it is demoralizing.   Non-boxing fans watched this fight and expect to see a Tyson like knockout. Mayweather only knocks out half of the fighters he faces and Pac has not knocked out anyone in 5 years.   It wasn't a brilliant performance by May but he dominated. 	this be about the fight only - not his domestic abuse charge . mayweather be an unbelievable boxer . pac be consider the second best fighter in the world and he could not hit mayweather . a professional boxer have round to beat up floyd but could not touch him . floyd be a defensive tactician and he prove that again . pac hit him wiht % accuracy , the same as everyone else floyd fight . why do pac not throw more punch ( rather than the he throw ) . if you only connect % of the time it be demoralize . non-boxing fan watch this fight and expect to see a tyson like knockout . mayweather only knock out half of the fighter he face and pac have not knock out anyone in year . it be n't a brilliant performance by may but he dominate .	dirtysoap	1430855737	36	0

But in this gif you can see that 2-seat is still rowing. So either 2-seat should have been out and wasn't (still rowing), or bow-seat should have been in and wasn't. Even if bow-seat wasn't supposed to be in, he could have been doing a better job of not letting his oar drag in the water so much, he's slowing the whole boat down doing it like he is. It's supposed to be gliding on top of the water, not submerged in it. 	yes , but normally you have people `` out '' in pair , to keep the balance even -- as in , bow-seat and out at the same time , then stern pair and middle four would be row . but in this gif you can see that be still row . so either should have be out and be n't ( still row ) , or bow-seat should have be in and be n't . even if bow-seat be n't suppose to be in , he could have be do a good job of not let his oar drag in the water so much , he 's slow the whole boat down do it like he be . it 's suppose to be glide on top of the water , not submerge in it .	heyheyitsashleyk	1432486427	1	0
05_12220	t1_crjgo7c	t1_crjegh0	Normally they have people sit out in pairs so they can use pressure on opposite sides of the boat to keep it balanced. Those boats, though huge, are really unstable, especially when you consider you've got over a thousand pounds of weight sliding forwards and backwards over and over and over again.  That being said it looks like either that guy should be rowing along with the person in front of him, or the person in front of him should also be not rowing. Yes, balancing like this adds a bit of drag. But it's better for practicing than having the boat flip flop while these novices learn to balance.

It was referencing the cold war and had a deeper political meaning.  T3's entire point was that fate is set in stone and you can't change it.

My last printer was a "side of the road junk pile" perfectly working HP Laserjet.  It lasted for 6 years and when it stopped working I threw it away.  I've found working wireless routers, vacuums that just needed cleaning and entire 3-5 year old computer systems (poorly maintained, never upgraded and infested with viruses, reformat and move on!) just sitting out for garbage.  By contrast, I've tried to give away perfectly good items over the weekend before they end up going to the dump and have had fairly little success.  I will never be too proud to take a look at a free pile of stuff.	i always stop and at least look at `` free '' pile of stuff by the side of the road . you never know what you might find . my last printer be a `` side of the road junk pile '' perfectly work hp laserjet . it last for year and when it stop work i throw it away . i 've find work wireless router , vacuum that just need cleaning and entire year old computer system ( poorly maintain , never upgrade and infest with virus , reformat and move on ! ) just sit out for garbage . by contrast , i 've try to give away perfectly good item over the weekend before they end up go to the dump and have have fairly little success . i will never be too proud to take a look at a free pile of stuff .	dizneedave	1432106087	3	0

You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase 'Paku-Paku,' which means to flap one's mouth open and closed.

I'm a computer coach at the library and an older man came in asking for help with uploading videos to YouTube.  He brought his selfie stick and asked if I had ever used one.    Apparently they connect via bluetooth and there's a button for the shutter on the handle.    I never put much thought in to it to begin with, but that was interesting to me.

Then we figured we'd get in trouble so we washed it off with gasoline. We weren't very bright kids. That was 43 years ago and I'm only marginally smarter now.

This became wide spread because EVERYBODY used to get Scholastic books in elementary school at one point or another.

The whole juxtaposition revolves around the subject being fat, and the punchline is "no, it's all my food because I'm fat".  Yes, Ted makes himself look stupid, but he's pointing out the obvious joke - that's too much food for one person.  Again, no problem with fat jokes (or any other subject), but I take offence to this because it's lazy writing and not funny at all. It has all the contrived setup of a *Married With Children* fat joke but none of the payoff of the clever insult.	the thing be misconstrue be a large amount of food , which only make sense because the person be fat , and they 're go to eat and entire office staff worth of lunch . the whole juxtaposition revolve around the subject be fat , and the punchline be `` no , it 's all my food because i 'm fat '' . yes , ted make himself look stupid , but he 's point out the obvious joke - that 's too much food for one person . again , no problem with fat joke ( or any other subject ) , but i take offence to this because it 's lazy writing and not funny at all . it have all the contrived setup of a *married with children* fat joke but none of the payoff of the clever insult .	chadsexytime	1432156175	-1	0

This really ought to change so that a child isn't thanking his father on "Mother's Day"; everyone should recognize that parenting can come from either parent.   That said, great gift from your son! Handmade ones are the best. And being a single parent is tough (and probably all the more so for dads).

I don't see this working in high school but I think the role reversal thing for a day does a lot to give kids some sense of power and provide some enjoyment out of what I remember being pretty mundane.   I remember feeling so insignificant as a kid (probably partly because I was the runt of my class) and because of that I always treat kids like they're adults...  None of that baby talk or phony pandering.  That will make a kid feel so cool and boost their self esteem when they feel they're an equal and have a voice.	that 's a pretty cool idea . i do n't see this work in high school but i think the role reversal thing for a day do a lot to give kid some sense of power and provide some enjoyment out of what i remember be pretty mundane . i remember feel so insignificant as a kid ( probably partly because i be the runt of my class ) and because of that i always treat kid like they 're adult ... none of that baby talk or phony pandering . that will make a kid feel so cool and boost their self esteem when they feel they 're an equal and have a voice .	brett84c	1430573579	1	0

I also am not 100% sure that it's "КЛАССНЫЙ", as JPEG artifacts and the fact that the journal seems to be wrapped into a some transparent cover that reflects ceiling lamps do mangle the letters, but I think the "...АССНЫЙ" part is rather discernible. Based on that, I could infer only "классный", as I can't really come up with another word with that ending. Also teacher's desk is the perfect place for that journal.	yep , you have a good point . i also be not % sure that it 's `` классный '' , as jpeg artifact and the fact that the journal seem to be wrap into a some transparent cover that reflect ceiling lamp do mangle the letter , but i think the `` ... ассный '' part be rather discernible . base on that , i could infer only `` классный '' , as i ca n't really come up with another word with that end . also teacher 's desk be the perfect place for that journal .

The real takeaway, in my opinion, is that being middle class does afford you a house and a warm bed, whereas those less fortunate are without. That doesn't make the middle class the enemy, but it should move you to reflect on how you treat others, their circumstance, and how you might be able to help those in need.  Trying to figure out who the monster is in this comic is exactly what this comic is being satirical about.

Sometimes people just don't know something's shooped or where it comes from, but as long as you can still find the source in the comments I think it makes it okay.  I feel the same regarding reposts. How much importance do some of the people here hold on being the first to share something they don't own?   I wish we could have a death battle between the silent community of upvotes and the community of commenters here. All proceeds and organs go to charity!	i see reddit as a place where people can share stuff whether they own it or not . sometimes people just do n't know something 's shooped or where it come from , but as long as you can still find the source in the comment i think it make it okay . i feel the same regarding reposts . how much importance do some of the people here hold on be the first to share something they do n't own ? i wish we could have a death battle between the silent community of upvotes and the community of commenters here . all proceeds and organ go to charity !	fuckSkit	1432061126	1	0

It matters what the rules of the sub reddit, and the rules of reddit as a whole actually are.  /r/funny, for example, has a rule that you may not rehost web comics to an image hosting site unless you are the creator of the comic.  Doesn't matter if you think it's ok or not, the rules in this sub reddit say that it is not.  I have no issue with reposts. We can't all live on reddit 24/7. Votes can decide whether a repost holds merit or not.  And my comment isn't about simply giving attribution to the original creator. It's about preventing spammy websites driving traffic to their own site by putting their watermark on other people's content.	it do n't matter what you see reddit as . it matter what the rule of the sub reddit , and the rule of reddit as a whole actually be . /r/funny , for example , have a rule that you may not rehost web comic to an image host site unless you be the creator of the comic . do n't matter if you think it 's ok or not , the rule in this sub reddit say that it be not . i have no issue with reposts . we ca n't all live on reddit . vote can decide whether a repost hold merit or not . and my comment be n't about simply give attribution to the original creator . it 's about prevent spammy website drive traffic to their own site by put their watermark on other people 's content .

05_06126	t1_cr6yg8j	t1_cr6xpmi	It's cut using razors, knives, scalpels, etc. It's known as ritual scarification and is quite common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Both men and women practice it (depending on the culture) and it's meant as a decoration to make people more beautiful. For those who think this is strange, just remember that Westerners enhance their beauty by putting implants in their breasts and buttocks, collagen in their lips, and botulinum toxin in their face. Which one is actually weirder? This is more of an extreme example of scarification that I've seen. Some can be as subtle as small lines. Dots are common as well. Google images should give you a wide array of images on this practice if you would like to see other examples. 	it 's cut use razor , knife , scalpel , etc . it 's know as ritual scarification and be quite common throughout sub-saharan africa . both men and woman practice it ( depend on the culture ) and it 's mean as a decoration to make people more beautiful . for those who think this be strange , just remember that westerner enhance their beauty by put implant in their breast and buttock , collagen in their lip , and botulinum toxin in their face . which one be actually weird ? this be more of an extreme example of scarification that i 've see . some can be as subtle as small line . dot be common as well . google image should give you a wide array of image on this practice if you would like to see other example .

Even so, it is widely believed that men do in fact have greater pain tolerance, on average. 	a few year ago i be curious and read a bunch of article about pain tolerance and gender . the short version be that it 's not a simple question to study because pain be subjective and it 's also difficult to tease apart physiological difference from cultural one ( e.g . men have more reason to act macho in test ) . even so , it be widely believe that men do in fact have great pain tolerance , on average .

Basically a dad is a scientist that can combine two creatures together into a chimera. He's been working on creating a sentient one, but his work is failing. If he fails, he loses his yearly salary from the government and his title. So in a last-ditch desperate move, he combines his young daughter and dog. The main character, Edward, finds out when the chimera says his name.  	a very depressing moment from full metal alchemist : brotherhood . spoiler ahead , because i 'm on mobile . basically a dad be a scientist that can combine two creature together into a chimera . he 's be work on create a sentient one , but his work be fail . if he fail , he lose his yearly salary from the government and his title . so in a last-ditch desperate move , he combine his young daughter and dog . the main character , edward , find out when the chimera say his name .

From wikipedia: &gt; The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for King Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Zeus accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from King Sisyphus before he reached the top which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as Sisyphean. 	for anyone who may not know : in greek mythology , sisyphus be a king who be punish for his repeated deceitfulness and dickery by be make to roll a huge boulder up a hill , and when he reach the top , the boulder would roll back down ... and this would be repeat forever and why this punishment ? from wikipedia : & gt ; the maddening nature of the punishment be reserve for king sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpass that of zeus himself . zeus accordingly display his own cleverness by enchant the boulder into roll away from king sisyphus before he reach the top which end up consign sisyphus to an eternity of useless effort and unending frustration . thus it come to pass that pointless or interminable activity be sometimes describe as sisyphean .

Wouldnt the position of moderator be nullified with a simple user block feature? See something you dont like/offends you? Block the user.  Seems easy, right?

I walked in and HE started laughing too.

Also because selfie sticks are ridiculous. 	thing about fairy tale , they seem to happen in the `` time of yore .

In fact, even full-time positions require more than 24 hours notice, unless you are sick, have an emergency, or have unexpected grievance (still an emergency, but somehow means you get less shit for the day; go figure).  Also, part-timers here can also expect to get written up for calling out a day they were supposed to show up; normally, this is an immediate 'final write-up', and is no longer considered informal, or simply a warning. At-will employment is bullshit.	as a part-time worker , in southern california , it be almost % plausible that you be n't get any sort of personal day . in fact , even full-time position require more than hour notice , unless you be sick , have an emergency , or have unexpected grievance ( still an emergency , but somehow mean you get less shit for the day ; go figure ) . also , part-timer here can also expect to get write up for call out a day they be suppose to show up ; normally , this be an immediate 'final write-up ' , and be no longer consider informal , or simply a warning . at-will employment be bullshit .

It got a little old after a while, but I only really raised an eyebrow when we read 'The Things They Carried' and was told that O'Brien had a very 'feminine' writing style because according to her the main character was caught up in cyclical thinking, reliving the same events over and over, re-evaluating them.  Which she attributed to a feminine mindset and writing style, and which I found ironically sexist to presume that thinking about something over and over for a period of time to be associated only with women.

05_13825	t1_crmzetu	t1_crmrlsv	I, Robot wasn't any better. Seriously rewatch it if you don't believe me.   On top of that it massacres Asimov's work. It would be ok if it wasn't related to Asimov's literature but instead the movie was basically the opposite of what Asimov was conveying.   The 3 laws of robotics don't work the way they did in the movie. Like at all. That was the cleverness of the short stories. It seemed like the laws were broke when in fact they aren't.

Chicken, turkey, beef, fish (though I don't give my cat fish per my vet) etc.  There will also be a protein and minimum moisture content. Generally speaking the higher the protein content the better the food. Addendum: should be animal protein not plant protein.  Vets also recommend cats get wet food as part of their diet as they often don't drink enough water to compensate for only eating dry food. Our cat eats 50% wet food(fancy feast) 50% dry food(Blue Buffalo) and his fur is much better than when we got him.

(They did in the Marvel Civil War Comics).	so here be a funny thing to notice . many time captain america and iron man have have funny little spat in the avenger movie . most recently a disagreement about swear . this set up a history of conflict between the two character . depend on the storyline of civil war we will see the two take different side .

You lose the required flexibility if you don't make use of it regularly.  What's convenient about being able to squat like this is that it's about as comfy as sitting. In some parts of the world, people wait (or loiter) like that. It's kinda like carrying a small foldable chair wherever you go.	kinda off-topic , but i 'll mention it anyways : his heel be touch the ground . all kid can squat properly . most western adult , however , can not . you lose the required flexibility if you do n't make use of it regularly . what 's convenient about be able to squat like this be that it 's about as comfy as sit . in some part of the world , people wait ( or loiter ) like that . it 's kinda like carry a small foldable chair wherever you go .	x-skeww	1431890593	4	0
