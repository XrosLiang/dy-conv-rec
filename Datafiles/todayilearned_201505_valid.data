What about self defense situations? I know people who think the act of firing a gun at all should be considered violent.   Even if you restrict it to gun deaths, those are still about 60% suicides, plus a good bit of accidents. Then you're left with gun homicides, which aren't really that big at all comparatively.  But anti-gun people don't care about that.

Remember reading story on here from someone who works at a shelter was helping a victim, but it turns out they were the abuser trying to find his partner at a local shelter. They have checks because it happens on both genders, like in your story she could check herself in and use it to prevent partner from getting help. But I bet its hard for same sex couples to escape in the same way, not sure what checks there are.   I know in UK NORDA project has separate shelters for men and like for women they have to keep the location secret.

That is why, in the movie Lincoln, you see how critical the passage of the 13th constitutional amendment was.  They had to pass that because this war time act could be ruled invalid once the war was over.  	legally , the emancipation proclamation be basically the same thing , it be a wartime act by the commander in chief of the military ( i.e . lincoln ) . that be why , in the movie lincoln , you see how critical the passage of the constitutional amendment be . they have to pass that because this war time act could be rule invalid once the war be over .

A more nefarious shop could remote the Apple-branded parts and replace them with cheap parts to then re-sell the Apple parts at a profit.

My (limited) knowledge of family law in the US (which has a ton of different jurisdictions and laws) basically puts the interests of the child above everything else.  That is why men, who have assumed the role of "father," are forced by the government to continue that role, at least financially, even if paternity tests prove they aren't related.

Like most European languages, we started using the plural pronoun as a respectful pronoun, then it just totally took over, until nowadays you only see "thou" in archaic works.  Since we lost a plural pronoun, we now have improvisations like *y'all, youse, y'inz*, etc.  Interestingly, *thou* was used in the bible for informality - it's supposed to convey an air of friendship and closeness with God.  Instead, it comes off nowadays to most as imposing, cold, and alien - because that's the only place they see Thou!	actually , they be independent . `` thou '' be the equivalent of spanish `` tu '' or german `` du '' , the singular pronoun . `` you '' be originally the plural version . like most european language , we start use the plural pronoun as a respectful pronoun , then it just totally take over , until nowadays you only see `` thou '' in archaic work . since we lose a plural pronoun , we now have improvisation like *y'all , youse , y'inz* , etc . interestingly , *thou* be use in the bible for informality - it 's suppose to convey an air of friendship and closeness with god . instead , it come off nowadays to most as imposing , cold , and alien - because that 's the only place they see thou !

It meets a pragmatic need that standard English does not formally fill, and is already a full-fledged pronoun in all varieties of southern English as well as African American Vernacular English.   In my experience even non-southerners find it convenient to say "you all" to specify 2pl, and from there all that's required is a contraction to get to "y'all".	my southern american bias may be show here , but it would not surprise me if `` y'all '' be to become at least semi-standardized in american english in the come decade . it meet a pragmatic need that standard english do not formally fill , and be already a full-fledged pronoun in all variety of southern english as well as african american vernacular english . in my experience even non-southerners find it convenient to say `` you all '' to specify , and from there all that 's require be a contraction to get to `` y'all '' .	rush_n_attack	1431300155	3	0

The term has only been recently appropriated to refer to riots by poor black communities, usually in response to police brutality.  Tulsa was the most horrific of these pogroms, but they occurred through out the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  These riots set back black communities decades in terms of wealth accumulation by forcing black people into ghettos.

The Tag Out comes from the lock being labeled, with a tag, informing of the current situation.  It becomes even more critical on machines that are very large, with multiple points of danger, often located in several different rooms. Someone can think "Oh, that guy is fixing Machine A, he told me so. Machine B is fine though, that's elsewhere". When in actuality they're both part of the same operation and turning any on is hazardous.	lock out tag out ( loto ) be use with industrial/machinery work to basically mean the power source/on-off switch be physically lock with a padlock ( or whatever fit the situation ) before any maintenance or repair be do . the tag out come from the lock be label , with a tag , informing of the current situation . it become even more critical on machine that be very large , with multiple point of danger , often locate in several different room . someone can think `` oh , that guy be fix machine a , he tell me so . machine b be fine though , that 's elsewhere '' . when in actuality they 're both part of the same operation and turn any on be hazardous .	salt-the-skies	1432024212	33	0

[Some](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/10/02/3575249/baker-hughes-fracking-chemical-disclosure/) fracking companies have shared their chemical mix. Also President Obama has made an executive order making it mandatory for all drilling companies to share their chemical this [June](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/new-rule-makes-companies-disclose-chemicals-used-fracturing).

05_01908	t1_cr0cd2o	t1_cr0ajkz	My understanding, and I might be incorrect, is that this particular portion is concerning underground injection of fluids and gases used in or related to the fracking wells, and that they are exempt to the regulations outlined in SDWA because of the passing of the 2005 Energy Policy Act unless they also contain specifically diesel fuels. This is at the federal level only though. The protection of groundwater resources during oil and gas extraction activities and regulation of any other injected chemicals is a responsibility of state governments.  Companies deciding to voluntarily share their chemical mix is cool, but that doesn't fall under the regulations. Because some are only voluntarily doing so, and many aren't because it is not mandatory, that sort of makes the executive order for disclosure not so redundant. 	my understanding , and i might be incorrect , be that this particular portion be concern underground injection of fluid and gas use in or relate to the fracking well , and that they be exempt to the regulation outline in sdwa because of the passing of the energy policy act unless they also contain specifically diesel fuel . this be at the federal level only though . the protection of groundwater resource during oil and gas extraction activity and regulation of any other injected chemical be a responsibility of state government . company decide to voluntarily share their chemical mix be cool , but that do n't fall under the regulation . because some be only voluntarily do so , and many be n't because it be not mandatory , that sort of make the executive order for disclosure not so redundant .

05_01908	t1_cr0cvk8	t1_cr0cd2o	You are right, there are regulations in the SDWA that fracking is exempt from. The title is misleading because fracking answers to EPA that takes authority because of the SDWA. Fracking answers to the EPA. My point of the companies sharing their chemical mix is to address the Loophole, not the Energy Policy Act itself. When I commented on the act of the redundancy, it was only to expose that for the most part, we do know what is going into the ground - maybe not so much the concentrations. Also because this post appears to be more political then assuring safety.	you be right , there be regulation in the sdwa that fracking be exempt from . the title be mislead because fracking answer to epa that take authority because of the sdwa . fracking answer to the epa . my point of the company share their chemical mix be to address the loophole , not the energy policy act itself . when i comment on the act of the redundancy , it be only to expose that for the most part , we do know what be go into the ground - maybe not so much the concentration . also because this post appear to be more political then assure safety .

EDIT- I see the legal eagles are objecting to the very notion of having their high priced jobs taken away. The reality is that with such backlogs that YEARS go by and with so much unequal application of laws - the only solution is COMPUTERIZATION. Now, you can keep your high priced help for the tricky bits but let me assure you if neuroscience can model parts of the brain and computer science can model almost everything else- SO CAN THE LAW BE MODELLED. 	law need to be update . computerization be need in legal system . edit- i see the legal eagle be object to the very notion of have their high price job take away . the reality be that with such backlog that years go by and with so much unequal application of law - the only solution be computerization . now , you can keep your high price help for the tricky bit but let me assure you if neuroscience can model part of the brain and computer science can model almost everything else- so can the law be modelled .

Anything that is designed to come in contact with an atmosphere (Nostromo's lander for example) would be smooth, any hard points like that would create a pressure build-up, result in a higher temperature at that point and more likely to just melt off.  So even if it was built that way with Greebles (is that a word? it is now), it'd eventually melt to a smoother surface through use. 	the real irony be that although it make it *look* more interesting , it make it more unlike what real vehicle design will do in the future . anything that be design to come in contact with an atmosphere ( nostromo 's lander for example ) would be smooth , any hard point like that would create a pressure build-up , result in a high temperature at that point and more likely to just melt off . so even if it be build that way with greebles ( be that a word ? it be now ) , it 'd eventually melt to a smoother surface through use .

Eventually, left wing members such as Roehm put up such a stink over this that Hitler had them killed in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.

05_04080	t1_cr6a5n0	null	It's an unpopular thought (and probably not the right one), but sometimes I wonder if making texting while driving legal would lessen the issue. People are going to text/talk while driving regardless. However, since it's illegal, they now try to hide it and put their phone down where it takes their eyes off the road. If it's legal and they can bring the phone up to the wheel while texting so that they can still somewhat see the road, I feel like the accident rate would go down to levels similar to where they were when cell phones first started getting popular.

And there's also the issue of, sure there's a lot of accidents caused by cell phone use, but I'd be interested to see whether cell phone-caused accidents aren't generally as lethal as, say, alcohol-caused accidents. Personally, I think texting is actually more likely to cause an accident in a residential place where you might rear-end someone in traffic than on the highway where all you really need to do is stay in your lane. Compared to being drunk, where you're probably equally likely to crash anywhere, or sleepy, where you're more likely to fall asleep on the highway, and obviously highway crashes are more often fatal because speed.  	this be a really interesting question . and there 's also the issue of , sure there 's a lot of accident cause by cell phone use , but i 'd be interested to see whether cell phone-caused accident be n't generally as lethal as , say , alcohol-caused accident . personally , i think texting be actually more likely to cause an accident in a residential place where you might rear-end someone in traffic than on the highway where all you really need to do be stay in your lane . compare to be drunk , where you 're probably equally likely to crash anywhere , or sleepy , where you 're more likely to fall asleep on the highway , and obviously highway crash be more often fatal because speed .	mandyrooba	1431411127	1	0

Furthermore, rappers aren't going out trying to produce max rhyme density in nearly all cases.  So, in that regard the researchers probably worded their conclusion a bit poorly as "outperforms" isn't really appropriate here or is a bit misleading when the subject of the article is rap lyrics. A better wording would be something like--- as expected the computer busted more rhymes---whether or not these rhymes are "dope" is a subject for further study.	lol yeah i agree , say that a computer can create line of text with more rhyme density than be present in most rap lyric do n't mean the computer be `` outperform '' anyone ... fill your rap to the brim with rhyme do n't make it objectively well . furthermore , rapper be n't go out try to produce max rhyme density in nearly all case . so , in that regard the researcher probably word their conclusion a bit poorly as `` outperforms '' be n't really appropriate here or be a bit mislead when the subject of the article be rap lyric . a good wording would be something like -- - as expect the computer bust more rhyme -- -whether or not these rhyme be `` dope '' be a subject for further study .

05_09632	t1_crocnx1	null	There was an episode of This American Life (IIRC) where a guy said all he wanted was for his corpse to be left on his friend's property and reclaimed by nature. But it turned out this was too legally tricky somehow.   I love that idea- simply being left in the wilderness, reclaimed by nature, maybe buried in a very shallow grave in a basic shroud.  Turns out vultures in Europe are having a hard time, since mad cow disease has made it necessary to cremate/dispose of the cow bodies ASAP, rather than simply leave the bodies to rot on the property- something like that. Vultures don't have much to eat anymore.	there be an episode of this american life ( iirc ) where a guy say all he want be for his corpse to be leave on his friend 's property and reclaim by nature . but it turn out this be too legally tricky somehow . i love that idea- simply be leave in the wilderness , reclaim by nature , maybe bury in a very shallow grave in a basic shroud . turn out vulture in europe be have a hard time , since mad cow disease have make it necessary to cremate/dispose of the cow body asap , rather than simply leave the body to rot on the property- something like that . vulture do n't have much to eat anymore .	chevymonza	1432863819	4	0

If Bush didn't "borrow" all that money from SS then we would not be in this boat.

At an early age (18-30) you could have say 50% higher risk (even downright high risk) and it would reduce by 10% every decade. As you get older that amount shrinks, but if you contribute more than a goal amount for your age there is no reason why you couldn't but they'd probably do it privately anyway.   Social Security also just doesn't have as many players in the market. 	it could always default to save bond and then allow a certain percentage of high risk asset . at an early age ( ) you could have say % high risk ( even downright high risk ) and it would reduce by % every decade . as you get old that amount shrink , but if you contribute more than a goal amount for your age there be no reason why you could n't but they 'd probably do it privately anyway . social security also just do n't have as many player in the market .	admronoc	1431987389	1	0

Place is a fascinating topic and speaks to one of the most basic of human experiences: how we apprehend the world. Places are environments that shape us as we simultaneously shape them. Is meaning in the world already constructed and we act accordingly? What power do we have to change the meaning of place? How is meaning (culture) influenced by materiality (physical environment)? It's a critical topic because as more of our interactions become automated, unconscious, and without physicality, real places-- the kinds that make us feel something-- become even more important to us.	hi- i 'm an anthropologist who study place . i assure you no one be go around say `` yup , that 's a place ... this one 's not ...

Now, after 20 years of strict gun control laws Poland has one of the lowest homicide-rates in the world: 0.02.

The primary driver of the seasons is actually the planet's tilted axis.  During months where the Northern Hemisphere is pointed towards the sun, the sun will be higher in the sky and stay out for longer (summer). When the Northern Hemisphere is pointed away from the sun, the sun appears low on the horizon and remains in the sky for a short period of time (winter). Northern summers are southern winters and vice versa.	that 's a common misconception . the change in earth 's distance from the sun be extremely small so it have a very small impact on the season . the primary driver of the season be actually the planet 's tilted axis . during month where the northern hemisphere be point towards the sun , the sun will be higher in the sky and stay out for long ( summer ) . when the northern hemisphere be point away from the sun , the sun appear low on the horizon and remain in the sky for a short period of time ( winter ) . northern summer be southern winter and vice versa .

The number of shots needed to have the gir ranges from 1 to 3 (usually) so the pars are from 3 to 5. If you only putt once, then you have one under the par (-1), and this is a birdie. An eagle is usually achived by reaching the green with a shot less then usually needed, then putting once, or a hole in one for a par 3. The usual "par" for a course is 72, 36 first 9 holes and 36 last 9 holes (18 holes total).

To do that you need to score below par on as many holes as you can. The par for each hole is designated by the creators of the course based on how difficult the hole is. A round of golf contains 18 different holes, whose pars usually range from 3-5. So scoring an 18 in any round of golf other than mini putt is pretty much impossible. Depending on the difficulty of the course, a round of golf usually consists of 65-75 strokes (hits) for professionals.	i 'm no golf expert , but i 'll try to help you out . obviously the objective of golf be to end the round with the low score possible . to do that you need to score below par on as many hole as you can . the par for each hole be designate by the creator of the course base on how difficult the hole be . a round of golf contains different hole , whose par usually range from . so score an in any round of golf other than mini putt be pretty much impossible . depend on the difficulty of the course , a round of golf usually consist of stroke ( hit ) for professional .	scrappyisachamp	1431060720	4	0

So long as they are not arbitrarily exclusive or prohibitive. Euclidian zoning and the strict separation of uses has many problems that were unforseen and  are being addressed through alternative zoning practices such as mixed-use and smart zoning. But the intent of *Euclid* was to minimize future nuisance issues that could arise from incompatible land use types, such as having a coal power plant next to an elementary school or a big box store within a secluded residential enclave.

When a system is in place that mandates quotas, two things happen: people that are underqualified get promoted just to fill a quota, or people just don't get promoted at all.  Edit: there is a third option that is more common in education. Some people who deserve advancement are passed over because their quota has already been filled. This is especially true in college admissions for asian-americans. Once the school admits their required 13%, it becomes exponentially more difficult for an Asian-american student to get in. 	sort of . when a system be in place that mandate quota , two thing happen : people that be underqualified get promote just to fill a quota , or people just do n't get promote at all . edit : there be a third option that be more common in education . some people who deserve advancement be pass over because their quota have already be fill . this be especially true in college admission for asian-americans . once the school admit their required % , it become exponentially more difficult for an asian-american student to get in .	voodoo_curse	1430890777	31	0

Ideally, Affirmative Action would mean that if there is a field which is particularly lacking of a group of people, be it certain minorities or women, AND there are two potential employees one a minority, and another, already very prevalent in the field, the minority would have an additional point in their favor for the sake of diversity. It would basically be like saying if two people got 100 on a test, but one person is from a group of people who was, perhaps under represented in the field, they would instead get 101.

No. But WAY better then it could have been.  And Federal spending has been shrinking most recently. (Again, not all on Obama.

In any case, in order to support your argument you need to explain, in clear terms, why federal borrowing is bad. This is not self-evident. The reason why the U.S. can borrow so much is because investors want to buy U.S. bonds. It's considered one of the safest investments on Earth. And since bond interest rates are very low, we know that demand for these financial products remains high (since investors are willing to effectively lend the government money for a low return).	debt and deficit be two different thing . i can assure you that the annual deficit have never be in the `` teen of trillion .

They treat it as though its some finite amount that doesn't increase or something. Like, if I have a dollar, that's a dollar that you'll never be able to make.   Wealth gaps mean nothing. What people should be concerned about is opportunity gaps.   That and its very easy to demonize the rich. When the economy goes tits-up like it did in 2008, politicians can go "Well, look, our policies had unintended consequences, and led to some horrible outcomes" or "Hey! Mr Scrooge over there is stealing your money!

What we commonly regard as the "volume" of the black hole is the range of the center within which the gravity is too strong for any information to escape. Since gravity is a direct product of mass, add enough mass and you get whatever "size" you want.  Of course, I'm fairly certain black holes are generally a fair bit smaller than the original mass that formed them. So, while it's certainly *possible* for a black hole of this size to exist, I've got no clue what could have been massive enough to create it.

Please note that there was also a large push to cut out saturated fats from our diet and increase carbohydrate consumption in this same time frame.    So, our low-fat diet culture with even the general population cutting down on saturated fats and increasing grains and other carbs most likely has a much more direct effect than some cryptic correlation between diet soda and obesity might have.  Edit:  Also, the rate started increasing BEFORE 1982.  Either this means that increasing obesity actually caused increasing diet soda consumption OR they actually have nothing to do with each other:  http://boingboing.net/2012/03/09/seduced-by-food-obesity-and-t.html  	ronald reagan be elect president in . coincidence ? i think not ! correlation really do not equal causation . please note that there be also a large push to cut out saturate fat from our diet and increase carbohydrate consumption in this same time frame . so , our low-fat diet culture with even the general population cut down on saturated fat and increase grain and other carbs most likely have a much more direct effect than some cryptic correlation between diet soda and obesity might have . edit : also , the rate start increase before . either this mean that increase obesity actually cause increase diet soda consumption or they actually have nothing to do with each other : <URL>	Boringbear	1431028423	5	0

Britain vaccinates for salmonella which is the reason they don't need to wash them. Unwashed in the US could have salmonella all over 'em and then any/everything you touch afterwards. Would sure be nice to store them in the cupboard though.  Genuinely curious, would you prefer we have to wash our eggs or vaccinate chickens? I have no idea about US dairy requirements, but I'm guessing you feel a gov. agency is overstepping their role, which is the same argument as to why we don't currently vaccinate chickens and have to wash our eggs.	well , you would probably prefer we start vaccinate our chicken then get unwashed egg . britain vaccinates for salmonella which be the reason they do n't need to wash them . unwashed in the u could have salmonella all over 'em and then any/everything you touch afterwards . would sure be nice to store them in the cupboard though . genuinely curious , would you prefer we have to wash our egg or vaccinate chicken ? i have no idea about u dairy requirement , but i 'm guess you feel a gov . agency be overstep their role , which be the same argument as to why we do n't currently vaccinate chicken and have to wash our egg .

When one visits a Psychiatrist the mental disease is not evident after examination and the pharmaceuticals rendered only serve to mask symptomatology via symptom substitution. Dentists don't substitute the symptomatology as far as I can determine. ERGO, the analogy is off by a mile IMHO. I'll grant kudos for the humorous response though.	point well take , but the article be discuss mental health and not dental health . when one visit a dentist the tooth decay be evident after examination . when one visit a psychiatrist the mental disease be not evident after examination and the pharmaceutical render only serve to mask symptomatology via symptom substitution . dentist do n't substitute the symptomatology as far as i can determine . ergo , the analogy be off by a mile imho . i 'll grant kudos for the humorous response though .

Not only is it coming from a think-tank with a strong libertarian bias, but it cherry-picks scientific research to support a statement that, as far as I know, has never been seen to such a strong extent by independent researchers. On top of this, anyone with half a clue about statistical research will tell you that there are numerous complications to correlation-based research, no matter how strong the implied relations are. To make bold claims like this, on a small number of studies and especially when conclusions are clearly meant support a political agenda proves nothing but the researchers own bias. Worse however, shady research like this is a sure-fire way to destroy the credibility of the social sciences in general. 	social scientist here . this study be a bad source for several reason . not only be it come from a think-tank with a strong libertarian bias , but it cherry-picks scientific research to support a statement that , as far as i know , have never be see to such a strong extent by independent researcher . on top of this , anyone with half a clue about statistical research will tell you that there be numerous complication to correlation-based research , no matter how strong the implied relation be . to make bold claim like this , on a small number of study and especially when conclusion be clearly meant support a political agenda prove nothing but the researcher own bias . bad however , shady research like this be a sure-fire way to destroy the credibility of the social science in general .

The data should be used if it benefits people, because if something positive can arise from the horrible fate, then it would not be in vain. A side note, a lot of scientific data these days comes from the torture and sacrifice of animals in laboratories, and other sources including wartime "research" and non consensual studies. But the data/remains should be handled respectfully and ethically. Recalls the memory of a guy in college throwing a section of a cadaver donor's vertebral column around like it was a football.

It was used in combination with other chemicals known as Rainbow Agents to attack the flora of Vietnam. Agent Orange was particularly cheap compared to the other agents so used the most. The reason why it was cheap is because the manufacturing method produced a lot of dioxins as the by-product and the Army refused to pay more for a less dioxin full chemical. Other agents used included Agent Blue - now known as roundup - which has no know negative health effects.   As for Napalm, that had been used by the the U.S. Military since late WWII to bomb German and Japanese cities. 	well i do n't think he say . `` bomb those unsuspecting child with napalm and agent orange '' agent orange be n't some mysterious chemical use to poison people . it be use in combination with other chemical know as rainbow agent to attack the flora of vietnam . agent orange be particularly cheap compare to the other agent so use the most . the reason why it be cheap be because the manufacturing method produce a lot of dioxin as the by-product and the army refuse to pay more for a less dioxin full chemical . other agent use include agent blue - now know as roundup - which have no know negative health effect . as for napalm , that have be use by the the u.s. military since late wwii to bomb german and japanese city .	admronoc	1431104450	11	0

Once you reach that maximum, you then have to justify any courses you take beyond it, and if you can't then you just can't take them and have to drop out. It comes up fairly often in engineering majors where taking a course two or three times is a pretty regular occurrence. That's another limit as well, if you fail a single course three times, you aren't allowed to take it again. And if that course is required for your major, you're SOL and either have to change majors or drop out because you are disallowed from continuing on that path.	i do n't know how it 's usually do , but my college have a cap on credit attempt . once you reach that maximum , you then have to justify any course you take beyond it , and if you ca n't then you just ca n't take them and have to drop out . it come up fairly often in engineering major where take a course two or three time be a pretty regular occurrence . that 's another limit as well , if you fail a single course three time , you be n't allow to take it again . and if that course be require for your major , you 're sol and either have to change major or drop out because you be disallow from continue on that path .

If it wasnt for the importing and exporting, Texas would have very very few jobs.

Horses cannot vomit and 2. If horses could vomit the last place they would do it would be in front of a place that has a bunch of medicine to keep him from vomiting.

Edwards received funding from NIAC from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper, describing a space elevator design. In it he stated that: "The first space elevator would reduce lift costs immediately to $100 per pound" ($220/kg).  *The gravitational potential energy of any object in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), relative to the surface of the earth, is about 50 MJ (15 kWh) of energy per kilogram (see geosynchronous orbit for details). Using wholesale electricity prices for 2008 to 2009, and the current 0.5% efficiency of power beaming, a space elevator would require US$220/kg just in electrical costs. Dr. Edwards expects technical advances to increase the efficiency to 2%.	*for a space elevator , the cost varies accord to the design . bradley c. edward receive funding from niac from to to write a paper , describe a space elevator design . in it he state that : `` the first space elevator would reduce lift cost immediately to $ per pound '' ( $ ) . *the gravitational potential energy of any object in geosynchronous orbit ( geo ) , relative to the surface of the earth , be about mj ( kwh ) of energy per kilogram ( see geosynchronous orbit for detail ) . use wholesale electricity price for to , and the current % efficiency of power beaming , a space elevator would require u $ just in electrical cost . dr. edward expect technical advance to increase the efficiency to % .

05_09492	t1_crnsnf2	t1_crnqq5n	Did they not read Tesla's work?    The ground is negatively charged, positive particles are stopped at the ionosphere and between it. The potential difference between the two are about 360,000 volts.   The earth has a charge of 96,500 coulombs. With a potential of 360,000 volts, the earth constitutes a capacitor of .25 farads (farads = coulombs/volts). If the formula for calculating the energy stored in a capacitor (E =1/2CV2) is applied to the earth, it turns out that the ambient medium contains 1.6 x 1011 joules or 4.5 megawatt-hours of electrical energy.  And they want to create a conductive short between the two? They will probably destroy the planet or at least discharge the entire atmosphere.. 	did they not read tesla 's work ? the ground be negatively charge , positive particle be stop at the ionosphere and between it . the potential difference between the two be about volt . the earth have a charge of coulomb . with a potential of volt , the earth constitute a capacitor of farad ( farad = coulombs/volts ) . if the formula for calculate the energy store in a capacitor ( e ) be apply to the earth , it turn out that the ambient medium contain x joule or megawatt-hours of electrical energy . and they want to create a conductive short between the two ? they will probably destroy the planet or at least discharge the entire atmosphere..	yellowsnow2	1432831237	4	0

Of course insurers will want to keep costs down, they don't care about health outcomes as long as their outlays aren't digging into profits.  Doctors should theoretically work in the best interest of the patient; however, with increasing debt loads, costs, lower medicare and medicaid expenditures, they are being persuaded with the large amounts of money offered by insurers.  The clear solution is a nationalized system of healthcare with only non-profit hospitals backed by government funding or a non-profit institution.  The same goes for health insurance.  We should emulate France or the UK, both of which manage amazing health outcomes at lower cost and without these horror stories.	this be really a matter of misplaced incentive and a direct result of a privatized insurance and healthcare system . of course insurer will want to keep cost down , they do n't care about health outcome as long as their outlay be n't dig into profit . doctor should theoretically work in the best interest of the patient ; however , with increase debt load , cost , low medicare and medicaid expenditure , they be be persuade with the large amount of money offer by insurer . the clear solution be a nationalized system of healthcare with only non-profit hospital back by government funding or a non-profit institution . the same go for health insurance . we should emulate france or the uk , both of which manage amaze health outcome at low cost and without these horror story .

I suspect it's because you're basically taking a straight line through a series of circular objects.  Just a more convoluted pi calculation where the circumference is a series of little circles.  So if you took the river length, and drew it out as a single, curved line, it would be very close to making a huge circle.  Very interesting.

Birds and other insects, even some mammals serve as pollinators, and we already pollinate some plants by hand, ourselves.  The world food chain *would* undoubtedly suffer, but Humanity is not going to die out. Nature (including us) is adaptive. Gaps in functionality will be filled by others. The 4 years claim is tripe. At worst, we'd just have to change our methods of cultivating enough food to feed the world's hungry mouths. There'd be shortages, maybe even famine.  But Humanity will *not* just give up and kick the bucket.	a lot of that be hype . whilst bee be important pollinator , they be n't the only pollinator . bird and other insect , even some mammal serve as pollinator , and we already pollinate some plant by hand , ourselves . the world food chain *would* undoubtedly suffer , but humanity be not go to die out . nature ( include us ) be adaptive . gap in functionality will be fill by others . the year claim be tripe . at bad , we 'd just have to change our method of cultivate enough food to fee the world 's hungry mouth . there 'd be shortage , maybe even famine . but humanity will *not* just give up and kick the bucket .

Why spend a ton of resources on a reconnaissance type vehicle that takes a crew of people to run and has a very limited range when you can just remotely pilot a stealth drone into a region from thousands of miles away, snap some pics/video, and drop a pinpoint air strike from above if needed?  Drones have effectively rendered subs obsolete at this point.

Except there was no water in the Rio Grande at the time, which is not something, from what I've seen of Germany, that any of them could have anticipated. They ended up wandering around in the desert until someone found them. I think America was a really good place to keep the German POWs. You might escape the camp, but you're not going to make it home.

Think of this as essentially translating from one dialect of a language to another as the word developed different connotations. This isn't the only example of this. Look at say the play [The Fantasticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasticks). In that play, the word "rape" is used to mean an abduction or kidnapping. As that meaning is very much not used anymore, modern productions replace the word rape with "abduction." 	this be n't pretend the word do n't happen . think of this as essentially translate from one dialect of a language to another as the word develop different connotation . this be n't the only example of this . look at say the play [ the fantasticks ] ( <URL> ) . in that play , the word `` rape '' be use to mean an abduction or kidnapping . as that meaning be very much not use anymore , modern production replace the word rape with `` abduction .

In addition, Wilhelm had a bad case of "Anglophilia" thanks to his English mother and grandmother, and would often wildly vacillate between hatred and adoration for his English relatives. The entire German royal family during Willy's formative years was not the most encouraging place to raise a child. Maybe he was a dick, but I'm not sure it was all simply a personality problem.	to be fair , kaiser wilhelm ii have the pleasure of grow up in a germany where bismarck hold power , where his grandfather rule for decade , and where his father be hat by both party for marry an english princess . in addition , wilhelm have a bad case of `` anglophilia '' thanks to his english mother and grandmother , and would often wildly vacillate between hatred and adoration for his english relative . the entire german royal family during willy 's formative year be not the most encouraging place to raise a child . maybe he be a dick , but i 'm not sure it be all simply a personality problem .	absurdjeneralization	1430625679	5	0

The way the Spanish lottery works is VERY different to how US lotteries work. They printed 180 of each possible number. So that 950 million was split 180 ways for each of those tickets, so 5.2 million to each ticket holder. This was then split in this case to the 70 households in the pool. These guys didn't all become millionaires or anything. In the US occasionally major lottery jackpots are split but it's pretty rare and when it happens it's almost never split more than 2 or 3 ways. 	anyone think the million number be bullshit , apparently it 's only severely mislead to u reader . the way the spanish lottery work be very different to how u lotteries work . they print of each possible number . so that million be split way for each of those ticket , so million to each ticket holder . this be then split in this case to the household in the pool . these guy do n't all become millionaire or anything . in the u occasionally major lottery jackpot be split but it 's pretty rare and when it happen it 's almost never split more than or way .
