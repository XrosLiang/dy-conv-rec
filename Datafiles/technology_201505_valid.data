The cable companies will continue to slowly to die, while things like Google fiber and municipal broadband will continue to grow.  Comcast and Time Warner are dinosaurs that will not possibly succeed once the baby boomers and older gen-xers are gone. I hate the cable companies as much as anyone else but they are pretty irrelevant except to older people that are too set in their ways to change.

As much as many people don't like to admit, their core business is delivery of information. They want people to be able to participate in the internet community, produce more accurate information, so that they can scrape it and package it with advertising.

Google is one of these monolith corporations that leaves room for few other companies to survive, typically industry giants themselves.   Since they have a near monopoly on the marketplace, they have no vested interest in fixing updates that damage their customer's product. We don't live in a free market. We're just going to buy their brand new phone. Sure, plenty of consumers may drop Android, but that's just a drop in the bucket.   It's stupid man.

They're warning you that if you continue to pirate, you're putting yourself at risk if BMG does subpoena your records and then file against you in court.  And they're not fines.

I use chrome's task manager to kill all active browsing tabs and extensions, clearing everything, yet when I check with any other system-wide task manager there can be 40+ other processes open, that when I exit out of, do not affect anything in chrome.	edit : [ somehow get downvotes for this , so here be a screenshot i be upload for proof . ] ( <URL> ) not true . i do it all the time . in fact there be so many , i instal a new task manager that allow me to batch close process to make free up memory easier , ever since chrome foolishly decide it do n't need a `` clear memory '' button in its task manager anymore . i use chrome 's task manager to kill all active browsing tab and extension , clear everything , yet when i check with any other system-wide task manager there can be other process open , that when i exit out of , do not affect anything in chrome .

But until general Upload and download speeds are equal, there is no real way to test against real life speeds.

If you read that link, you'll see that TWC is changing the channel bonding. They're going from 4x4 to 8x4 and eventually, 16x4 and possibly 24x8. The 16x4 equipment became available last year, and Comcast and TWC are already rolling out 16x4 (600 mbps) service in some areas.   It takes time to develop new gear, and Comcast and Time Warner have been rolling it out as soon as it entered the market.   In October 2013, DOCSIS 3.1 was released which scales to 10 Gbps. So Comcast and TWC are planning on 10 Gbps upgrades too.   DOCSIS 3.1 has some regulatory hurdles because they have to kill legacy services (like analog cable) to implement it.

05_01520	t1_crhvzsl	t1_crhqxnn	As a software developer it's entirely normal for people in my field to say they are hacking on something which means building something software oriented.  The Jargon File defines a hacker as:  &gt;A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  I doubt the people over at Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com) consider themselves to be doing things that are immoral.

But also so that people have available the work that has been done before, so that we don't have everybody reinventing the wheel, so to speak. Patents give a jumping off point.

Learn to look stuff up yourself and educate yourself. If you sit around expecting others to explain things to you, then you're only going to get whatever explanation they choose to supply you, which may or may not be accurate or truthful or misleading. Learn to find your own good sources, how to recognize good information from bad, and make sense of it yourself. This is an important life skill that all adults must have in order to avoid making stupid mistakes that might cost them. The sooner you learn it, the better. 	an explanation that would likely make sense to you would be exhaustive for anyone here who might attempt it . fuck google it . learn to look stuff up yourself and educate yourself . if you sit around expect others to explain thing to you , then you 're only go to get whatever explanation they choose to supply you , which may or may not be accurate or truthful or misleading . learn to find your own good source , how to recognize good information from bad , and make sense of it yourself . this be an important life skill that all adult must have in order to avoid make stupid mistake that might cost them . the sooner you learn it , the good .	sylban	1433075060	4	0

I want the added security that a chunk of metal, preferrably with some sort of little electronic sensor on it, like my 2002 GM car has, sticking into a hole in the car. Of course a lot of things can be hotwired if you can break into the car, but keyless ignition is just removing a lot of barriers that would otherwise keep out all but a determined car thief.  These keyless ignitions mean that your car can be easily stolen in 10 minutes by someone who can be hiding in an alley near your car, not someone who has to sit there, working on the car perhaps in plain sight.	i completely agree . i think that keyless ignition , in particular , be just stupid . i want the added security that a chunk of metal , preferrably with some sort of little electronic sensor on it , like my gm car have , stick into a hole in the car . of course a lot of thing can be hotwired if you can break into the car , but keyless ignition be just remove a lot of barrier that would otherwise keep out all but a determined car thief . these keyless ignition mean that your car can be easily steal in minute by someone who can be hide in an alley near your car , not someone who have to sit there , work on the car perhaps in plain sight .

I don't think I've watched cable television for over 2 years now because it's actually easier to DL what I want when I want it.  What I was trying to say though is that clearly ads are effective and you need to think bigger picture. Just because you and your friends use adblocker doesn't mean most people do. For a lot of people, it's hard enough just to DL another browser instead of IE. As for the revenue, clearly they're working because I got news for you.
