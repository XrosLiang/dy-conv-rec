Google often gets free use of government land and equipment. That includes free server space on government property include free power.   Some cities gave Google free access to rights of way.

It basically came out early 2015. 10nm was supposed to come out mid-2016. So now it's early 2017, so it's already "not on track". They just re-adjusted the schedule from the already delayed 14nm, and for 10nm to be 2 years after that.   It's also possible 10nm could be further delayed to mid-2017 for mainstream use, which means other foundries will be further decreasing the gap with Intel.	interesting , because intel say `` it 's on track '' with , and that the late delay be only a problem with the process . be suppose to come out mid . it basically come out early . be suppose to come out . so now it 's early , so it 's already `` not on track '' . they just re-adjusted the schedule from the already delay , and for to be year after that . it 's also possible could be far delay to for mainstream use , which mean other foundry will be far decrease the gap with intel .	johnmountain	1422791442	21	0

You can still have pirate radio, but they'll find you very quickly if you start transmitting illegally on licensed frequencies or unlicensed frequencies beyond the TX power limits.  However, you are free to transmit whatever you want on the unlicensed bands and spectrums, for example Wifi. If you were to make a wifi mesh network with your neighbours, and had long-links using wireless optical interconnects, it would be 100% legal per FCC regulations.	i think you be confuse here . you can still have pirate radio , but they 'll find you very quickly if you start transmit illegally on licensed frequency or unlicensed frequency beyond the tx power limit . however , you be free to transmit whatever you want on the unlicensed band and spectrum , for example wifi . if you be to make a wifi mesh network with your neighbour , and have long-links use wireless optical interconnects , it would be % legal per fcc regulation .

Smartphones have the same voice recognition technology, iPhone with Siri and Android with OK Google voice commands. They are *activated*, and then filter what you say, not always on, you can turn it off and never have it bother you.  Samsung is actually doing everyone a favour by warning that if you leave it on at all times it will obviously constantly listen to you, so you should turn it off if you don't want that.  But if you really don't trust it then you can buy a "dumb" phone, TV, watch, video game and never call services that record what you say.	do n't worry about it . this thread be full of privacy circlejerking and idiot who do n't understand how technology work . smartphones have the same voice recognition technology , iphone with siri and android with ok google voice command . they be *activated* , and then filter what you say , not always on , you can turn it off and never have it bother you . samsung be actually do everyone a favour by warn that if you leave it on at all time it will obviously constantly listen to you , so you should turn it off if you do n't want that . but if you really do n't trust it then you can buy a `` dumb '' phone , tv , watch , video game and never call service that record what you say .

They have proven their adgenda, and those who are no part of it are ignorant about it. For example, look at the YouTube interview with President Obama. When Tom Wheeler and Net Neutrality came up, it was clear he had no idea about the wokings and opinions about the issue, but he gave a valid response becuase thats what politicians do. Sadly its too late now to do anything but protest and hope.

02_00608	t1_coeff6n	null	It's interesting how swatting has seemingly increased in frequency over time.   It would be interesting to read a follow-up of lessons learned from multiple swatting incidents. Are there common trends regarding source such as blocked numbers? Similarities in terms used? Ability to follow-up a confirmation?  Seems we should be able to categorically analyze these things to boil down probabilities of a potentially fake call. I'm thinking along the lines of how tax returns are analyzed to identify traits that may indicate potential fraud, and alert the return for further audit scrutiny.   An indicator for intake staff to escalate some additional confirmation protocols, and alert swat responding that this may be a case where some modicum of restraint may be justified, might just save someone from getting killed in one of these. 	it 's interesting how swatting have seemingly increase in frequency over time . it would be interest to read a follow-up of lesson learn from multiple swat incident . be there common trend regard source such as blocked number ? similarity in term use ? ability to follow-up a confirmation ? seem we should be able to categorically analyze these thing to boil down probability of a potentially fake call . i 'm think along the line of how tax return be analyze to identify trait that may indicate potential fraud , and alert the return for further audit scrutiny . an indicator for intake staff to escalate some additional confirmation protocol , and alert swat respond that this may be a case where some modicum of restraint may be justify , might just save someone from get kill in one of these .	kerosion	1423347382	1	0

02_00654	t1_coffkib	t1_cof8pva	The pentium 4 was going to be a massive flop, but Intel used its influence in the computing industry to push their compiler to the benchmarking firms.  Their compiler was limited to a few intel-only instructions and generic instructions, but no AMD-only ones.  So the Pentium 4 outperformed AMD's Athlon in benchmarks by a wide margin, where in reality, the Pentium 4 was really shitty and barely maintained Pentium 3's performance.  At least that's one of the reasons why AMD isn't dominant right now.  Edit: Intel also paid HP and the other OEMs to delay AMD products with the Athlon 64 vs the Prescott.	the pentium be go to be a massive flop , but intel use its influence in the computing industry to push their compiler to the benchmarking firm . their compiler be limit to a few intel-only instruction and generic instruction , but no amd-only one . so the pentium outperform amd 's athlon in benchmark by a wide margin , where in reality , the pentium be really shitty and barely maintain pentium 's performance . at least that 's one of the reason why amd be n't dominant right now . edit : intel also pay hp and the other oems to delay amd product with the athlon vs the prescott .	baobrain	1423438929	4	0

The information is quite likely not 'stored' or sold to third parties. It's simply data.  Like playing a videogame, or an MMO, your 'commands' are sent to a server, and handled.

How much of that could there possibly be?  Good job, RIAA.  And what's the marginal rate of spending in somalia?  And the average per capita income?  A 120$/year investment could be dozens of local jobs.  **edit** looking it up the foreign direct investment ranges from -8 to 100M$usd /year, so it's kind of a small dip (but given that it occasionally goes negative...every bit helps).  But with a spending multiplier of 5 based on a reasonable lowball estimate of the marginal propensity for spending 120$/year would be more than enough to employ at least 1 employee in somalia at a gdp/capita of about 550$ 	bad than that . kat be presumably pay for domain name service . the riaa just kill a constant stream of foreign investment in the somalian economy . how much of that could there possibly be ? good job , riaa . and what 's the marginal rate of spending in somalia ? and the average per capita income ? a $ /year investment could be dozen of local job . **edit** look it up the foreign direct investment range from to $ usd /year , so it 's kind of a small dip ( but give that it occasionally go negative ... every bit help ) . but with a spending multiplier of base on a reasonable lowball estimate of the marginal propensity for spend $ /year would be more than enough to employ at least employee in somalia at a gdp/capita of about $	themusicgod1	1423500500	13	0

Thefts and robberies of iPhones fell 40 percent.  It's not the "kill switches" that stopped this. It's the TouchID in iphones. When thieves can't use the phones without the owner's fingerprint, a kill-switch isn't necessary. So what we needed all along is a way to ensure only the *owner* of the phone can use the phone, and not anyone else. Kill switches, whether controlled by the companies or by the government are *completely unnecessary*.	bullshit ! & gt ; in san francisco , overall robbery and theft drop percent from to , but those involve smartphones be down percent . theft and robbery of iphones fell percent . it 's not the `` kill switch '' that stop this . it 's the touchid in iphones . when thief ca n't use the phone without the owner 's fingerprint , a kill-switch be n't necessary . so what we need all along be a way to ensure only the *owner* of the phone can use the phone , and not anyone else . kill switch , whether control by the company or by the government be *completely unnecessary* .	johnmountain	1423645798	-1	0

Do to the energy of the potassium-oxygen reaction, the available power is likely pretty significant.  I'm curious about the "re-chargeability", which basically means reversing the reaction. In zinc-air fuel cells, it's difficult because zinc forms stalactites during electrolysis. However, with zinc-air's, the "waste", zinc oxide, can be dissolved in Potassium Hydroxide, electrolyzed out, and simply melted/re-cast into zinc pellets.

As of 4.4, google skipped the SE chip, which a lot of carriers denied access to, thus, the reason why tap-n-pay didn't work before.  As of 4.4, google did it all in software to skip the SE all together.  4.4.4 should have fixed it, but its still showing that its not working correctly.

But at least we aren't annexing sovereign nations, threatening to nuke people and we don't have completely rigged elections that ensure one party always wins.   Really the US is no more evil than France and Britain. We just have way more military power than them. The good news is that the US military is comprised of mostly normal people with varying social and political views. These people generally care more about their family well being than the orders they take. So I doubt any campaign for global conquest would really work out. If they tried that a huge portion would drop out as soon as they could. 	you 're right . but at least we be n't annex sovereign nation , threaten to nuke people and we do n't have completely rig election that ensure one party always win . really the u be no more evil than france and britain . we just have way more military power than them . the good news be that the u military be comprise of mostly normal people with vary social and political view . these people generally care more about their family well be than the order they take . so i doubt any campaign for global conquest would really work out . if they try that a huge portion would drop out as soon as they could .

02_01106	t1_coksdf1	t1_cokpnv0	As long as your goal is using the battery during peak rates and recharging during low rates, that is easily accomplished using a 240V Oven socket. The problem most people face is that they only have this type of socket in the kitchen and not the basement/garage where it would be needed.  If this is the usage model, there will be two typical scenarios for this battery unit: A 240V high-amp socket run to the garage/basement or the battery being installed outside next to the AC unit.  Either way, the install costs are a few hundred dollars. For homes that are going with an electric vehicle, the garage makes the most sense since high amp service will already be installed there for charging the car and the main breaker panel is often located in the garage anyways.	as long as your goal be use the battery during peak rate and recharge during low rate , that be easily accomplish use a oven socket . the problem most people face be that they only have this type of socket in the kitchen and not the basement/garage where it would be need . if this be the usage model , there will be two typical scenario for this battery unit : a high-amp socket run to the garage/basement or the battery be instal outside next to the ac unit . either way , the install cost be a few hundred dollar . for home that be go with an electric vehicle , the garage make the most sense since high amp service will already be instal there for charge the car and the main breaker panel be often locate in the garage anyways .

I copied files for a teacher back in the 90's from his 1982 computer's 4MB hard disk over to a newer storage medium (using 5 1/4" floppies).  Unfortunately there is no modern computer program (even in the 90's) that can open those files which contain schematics, and the computer they were on had to be thrown out.  The printer on that computer was non-functional and there is no VM that can emulate that platform/software that I ever found.  So those files now exist as crappy screenshots.  This is just one example of many that I can provide.  Stuff gets obsolete all the time and backwards compatibility is becoming quite rare.	this be interesting and i agree with it . i copy file for a teacher back in the 's from his computer 's hard disk over to a new storage medium ( use '' floppy ) . unfortunately there be no modern computer program ( even in the 's ) that can open those file which contain schematic , and the computer they be on have to be throw out . the printer on that computer be non-functional and there be no vm that can emulate that platform/software that i ever find . so those file now exist as crappy screenshots . this be just one example of many that i can provide . stuff get obsolete all the time and backwards compatibility be become quite rare .	philmatu	1423921513	8	0
02_01139	t1_colnp2b	t1_col8a1z	It may seem tangential, but this is partially why I dislike the trend in some countries to extend copyright protections to ridiculous lengths. Piracy is not really a -good- thing, especially when it is a movie or game that has just been released. However, once a product is off the market I think it is good that the software be uploaded to a file sharing website.  I have personally had several cases where I've been able to open old files by downloading images of the long gone software from places like ThePirateBay. While those who upload copies of old software and game ROMs might technically be breaking the law, they are also helping to preserve items that would otherwise disappear.	it may seem tangential , but this be partially why i dislike the trend in some country to extend copyright protection to ridiculous length . piracy be not really a -good- thing , especially when it be a movie or game that have just be release . however , once a product be off the market i think it be good that the software be upload to a file share website . i have personally have several case where i 've be able to open old file by download image of the long go software from place like thepiratebay . while those who upload copy of old software and game rom might technically be break the law , they be also help to preserve item that would otherwise disappear .

Here's what it could look like: https://imgur.com/5RKYP8F  but this would be a huge investment for them. Utilities are known to amortize their assets for insanely long periods of time. Exhibit A: the grid.   I think they will go for it eventually, but I don't count on utilities to make the first move on energy storage. If you can get back the money you invest in it within a decent period of time by off-setting peak demand charges, then it's worth it for the consumers to move forward. Bonus, you minimize your reliance on the grid. 	of course . tesla actually plan for utility scale energy storage system . here 's what it could look like : <URL> but this would be a huge investment for them . utility be know to amortize their asset for insanely long period of time . exhibit a : the grid . i think they will go for it eventually , but i do n't count on utility to make the first move on energy storage . if you can get back the money you invest in it within a decent period of time by off-setting peak demand charge , then it 's worth it for the consumer to move forward . bonus , you minimize your reliance on the grid .

In alot of places gas is very cheap also . And yes you will always depend on a company , i bet tesla is going to depend on several other companies ti make their products work. Also if you are a welder and a craftsman it will be impossible to not drain out those batteries in a matter of hours since many tools run on very high current . I just don't get it electric cars and houses with batteries that just seems way to dependable 	yea because gas be always available you can store and transport gas and the gas company be not affect by weather or it do not have outage . in alot of place gas be very cheap also . and yes you will always depend on a company , i bet tesla be go to depend on several other company ti make their product work . also if you be a welder and a craftsman it will be impossible to not drain out those battery in a matter of hour since many tool run on very high current . i just do n't get it electric car and house with battery that just seem way to dependable	vivalarevoluciones	1423968905	1	0

Plus, the comparison doesn't mention what lens they are using.  If it is the kit 18-55 then it would be soft on the details, especially at the edges unlike a quality lens.

Which isn't that surprising given that the watch will sit on the wrist at varying levels of pressure depending on the wearer.

Something akin to a family plan, you know where the spouse and kids all have phones, but all under one plan, and it's way way cheaper than buying several individual plans.    Then there's the tablet devices that have built in 4g antennas, I think a lot of those are more like prepaid plans.    Anyhow I like the idea of watch that can replace the phone entirely.

It means Apple stuff will never be bleeding edge like you can get with Android, but at the same time it's pretty much guaranteed to work reliably across the board.  As a person who spends all day at work dealing with tech issues, the last thing I want on a technical gadget for my personal use is something I need to fuck around with to make it work right.  That said, I'm going to wait until at least the iWatch 2.0 simply because the 2nd gen iPhone, iPad, and iPad mini were all vastly better than the 1st gen versions.  	one thing i like about apple be that they wo n't include thing that do n't meet their expectation of quality . it mean apple stuff will never be bleed edge like you can get with android , but at the same time it 's pretty much guarantee to work reliably across the board . as a person who spend all day at work deal with tech issue , the last thing i want on a technical gadget for my personal use be something i need to fuck around with to make it work right . that say , i 'm go to wait until at least the iwatch simply because the gen iphone , ipad , and ipad mini be all vastly good than the gen version .	lordmycal	1424195586	-2	0

Lost bits of data mean that those bits need resent before the byte is completed.  Too many lost bits, more latency in producing the sound you hear.  Which means that if there's enough lost bits, bytes of sound are intentionally dropped so as to not impact the timing of the audio/video.  That's simplifying it, it's more complex.  That said, I don't spend more than $12 for even 6' HDMI cables.  I'm not going to spend $160 for SD cards either.  But that's because I'm cheap and don't need near perfection.	storage medium and digital cable can affect end result of sound quality . this be very simple people . digitally reproduced sound be create by bit of data . lose bit of data mean that those bit need resent before the byte be complete . too many lose bit , more latency in produce the sound you hear . which mean that if there 's enough lost bit , byte of sound be intentionally drop so as to not impact the timing of the audio/video . that 's simplify it , it 's more complex . that say , i do n't spend more than $ for even ' hdmi cable . i 'm not go to spend $ for sd card either . but that 's because i 'm cheap and do n't need near perfection .	stromm	1424393005	1	0

What you mention is applicable to non "checksum corrected" bitstreams like CD audio, or HDMI video output - but this article is about SD cards which are "block access" devices.  For block access devices, the read/write error management is handled at lower layers of the system (firmware). The operating system and user applications like sound/video players do not have to handle "lost bits", because the storage device never passes blocks with errors up to the OS/apps. Any errors due to physical storage are handled internally in the storage controller and could translate into lower transfer speeds (if errors are recoverable by the firmware), or total failure of the transfer session (if non-recoverable). 	that 's not how sd card ( and generally , modern digital computer storage ) work . what you mention be applicable to non `` checksum correct '' bitstreams like cd audio , or hdmi video output - but this article be about sd card which be `` block access '' device . for block access device , the read/write error management be handle at low layer of the system ( firmware ) . the operating system and user application like sound/video player do not have to handle `` lose bit '' , because the storage device never pass block with error up to the os/apps . any error due to physical storage be handle internally in the storage controller and could translate into low transfer speed ( if error be recoverable by the firmware ) , or total failure of the transfer session ( if non-recoverable ) .	evilutor	1424404167	1	0

If you get a Windows DVD, it just has Windows on it. In one case, you have one company making the hardware and OS, in the other, you have a hardware mfr. selling a system with an OS, to which they add junk.  Without arguing the merits of the OSes, Apple was forced to acknowledge the strengths of mass standardization when then changed from entirely proprietary hardware designs, adopting architectures used by many other manufacturers.  One of the results of that is that it's pretty easy to put together an inexpensive machine that'll run Mac OS.

02_01726	t1_cosykzd	t1_cosyap9	It'll create a "burst of speed" each time you perform a lookup that isn't already in the local cache, in that you're not waiting on the DNS lookup. However after that record is in the cache the speeds will be the same as it was when the local cache was updated from the ISP servers. The effects as a whole I suppose are dependent on how often your cache expires records.  I also know these kinds of DNS services used to come with the caveat that they can actually decrease speeds by causing you to use sub-optimal CDN connections, but I'm not sure how true that is.	it 'll create a `` burst of speed '' each time you perform a lookup that be n't already in the local cache , in that you 're not wait on the dns lookup . however after that record be in the cache the speed will be the same as it be when the local cache be update from the isp server . the effect as a whole i suppose be dependent on how often your cache expire record . i also know these kind of dns service use to come with the caveat that they can actually decrease speed by cause you to use sub-optimal cdn connection , but i 'm not sure how true that be .	venom8599	1424564913	11	0

In a way,  Microsoft has already done their part by lowering the price of their OEM Windows licenses. It now costs less for Lenovo and Dell and HP to include Windows on their PCs,  and hopefully they can pass that savings on to the consumer instead of subsidizing the price of their PCs with crapware sales.

However, if you get into MacBook Pro territory, you'll be spending more for the same specs on an Apple product. You don't even get a 1080p screen on Apple laptops until you bump all the way up to Retina, which is a minimum of $1300.  I don't mean this to sound like I hate Apple or anything.

I'm not talking about the difference between an iPod and an iMac. Apple has one design for notebooks / laptops, one design for their phones, one design for their tablets.

They may delete the original sample as soon as its been processed through this system.  * the voice recognition of these services isn't good enough yet, so there's a nice advantage for us all when they do this.  So, while its a little creepy to think about, this is a good thing for users of these services. Now, of course, that doesn't mean Apple or Google *isn't* doing something bad with your voice commands.

In fact nothing he said during his speech today in opposition to the legislation talked about throttling, blocking, or paid prioritization. He is worried about potential changes that the Title II could cause. He brought up the issue of broadening powers and worried that future FCC commissions would not preserve the same rules. Or that they might use their ability enact future taxes. Michael had similar fears.  Also I recommend watching the whole proceedings. Notice how Pai tries to make it look like "Obama's" plan and twist it into an Obamacare thing with his rhetoric. He had no valid arguments through his speech. Even his remarks on 706(b) were unjustified.	pai 's argument be all base on potential issue in the future . in fact nothing he say during his speech today in opposition to the legislation talk about throttling , block , or pay prioritization . he be worry about potential change that the title ii could cause . he bring up the issue of broaden power and worry that future fcc commission would not preserve the same rule . or that they might use their ability enact future tax . michael have similar fear . also i recommend watch the whole proceeding . notice how pai try to make it look like `` obama 's '' plan and twist it into an obamacare thing with his rhetoric . he have no valid argument through his speech . even his remark on ( b ) be unjustified .

02_02342	t1_coy9lhd	t1_coy8rtv	The thing is that an average household won't ever use 737 Gallons of water. Average water usage hit a plateau quite a while back.  In the very near future, the average household will be using 737 GB of data and that average will continue to rise. Data usage is nowhere near a plateau.  Do you trust data pricing to be regulated and adjusted in a fair and timely manner by the same people who, until last month, classified a Broadband internet connection as 4 Mbps?  Fun Fact: The FCC classified Broadband as 200 ***Kbps*** until **2010**. It took them another 5 years to reclassify it again from 4 Mbps to 25 Mbps.	the thing be that an average household wo n't ever use gallon of water . average water usage hit a plateau quite a while back . in the very near future , the average household will be use gb of data and that average will continue to rise . data usage be nowhere near a plateau . do you trust data pricing to be regulate and adjust in a fair and timely manner by the same people who , until last month , classify a broadband internet connection as mbps ? fun fact : the fcc classify broadband as ***kbps*** until . it take them another year to reclassify it again from mbps to mbps .

The FCC is allowed to impose fines on individuals for that hate speech that it defined  Now, the important part I think is that, we don't know what's hate speech beforehand. I'm sure they'll probably throw "fag" and "the n-word" on there, but really, could be anything, right? Like, Comcast could say to the FCC, "people criticizing our customer service online is hurtful to us," and the FCC could turn around and fine people for bitching about Comcast.	i 'll see what i can do later this evening . the tl ; dr version be basically : . the fcc determine what 's consider `` hate speech .

This is why having a formal democracy isn't enough, you need to have an effective democracy. If the law says that every citizen has a right to legal defense, but in practice you need a ton of money to effectively defend yourself *and* prosecutors can take your money away from you before conviction, then you effectively don't have a right to legal defense.
