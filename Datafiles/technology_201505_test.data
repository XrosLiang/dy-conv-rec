They got brainwashed into thinking they have choice and power by democratic vote. They see themselves as free people rather than slaves. They fear violence either from or to the government. The power equilibrium between the people and the government has been broken. Dissidents are labeled as domestic terrorists and systematically removed from the society before even anyone notices what happened. No matter how positively looked at, there is no logical way of changing the situation in near future. No coincidence, incidence, event, person, organization, movement will have enough power to have meaningful change.	that point have pass long ago . it be point of no return from now on . people become complacent . they get brainwash into think they have choice and power by democratic vote . they see themselves as free people rather than slave . they fear violence either from or to the government . the power equilibrium between the people and the government have be break . dissident be label as domestic terrorist and systematically remove from the society before even anyone notice what happen . no matter how positively look at , there be no logical way of change the situation in near future . no coincidence , incidence , event , person , organization , movement will have enough power to have meaningful change .

It's Apple (and Sony) for deciding to not to update their Youtube applications on *their devices* to support the new Youtube API 3 (and make the app *use* the HTML5 standard).  Could Google keep providing Youtube videos for Flash-based apps *and* extend the lifetime of Youtube API 2? Yes. Would that be infrastructually/technically viable (have a whole other format and API for legacy applications)? No.	i do n't make my point very clear , but google be not the one to blame here . it 's apple ( and sony ) for decide to not to update their youtube application on *their devices* to support the new youtube api ( and make the app *use* the standard ) . could google keep provide youtube video for flash-based apps *and* extend the lifetime of youtube api ? yes . would that be infrastructually/technically viable ( have a whole other format and api for legacy application ) ? no .	haabilo	1431258721	26	0

Now if ANYONE uploads something that matches part of that Content ID profile a DMCA will get filed or revenue will get sent to the owner of the Content ID profile.

05_00235	t1_cqxutop	t1_cqxthpe	honestly Chrome's memory usage has a lot to do with extensions and shared memory. Each extension gets it's own process which needs to do work for every tab, so a badly written extension (adblock is a prime example of this) causes massive CPU and memory usage.  Also chrome uses shared memory excessively. This is basically that (for example) each tab could share the same block of 50mb of memory. So if you look at 2 tabs memory usage, one could say 150mb and the other 200mb but in reality they both only use up 300mb total.  Be careful with your extensions and don't worry as much about what the numbers you see are and most people are fine.	honestly chrome 's memory usage have a lot to do with extension and share memory . each extension get it 's own process which need to do work for every tab , so a badly write extension ( adblock be a prime example of this ) cause massive cpu and memory usage . also chrome us share memory excessively . this be basically that ( for example ) each tab could share the same block of of memory . so if you look at tabs memory usage , one could say and the other but in reality they both only use up total . be careful with your extension and do n't worry as much about what the number you see be and most people be fine .

What Verizon seems to be doing is getting people to agree to the concept of capped internet.  Sure, it is going to be really hard to hit 10 TB for most people, but think of the future.  They are trying to shift an unlimited commodity (which is bad for them) to a limited one . The price and reasonableness of the cap at this moment doesn't really matter, because they are under no obligation to change it and consumers data demands are only increasing.    	what no one seem to be mention be that while this cap be reasonable now , how long will it remain that way ? what verizon seem to be do be get people to agree to the concept of capped internet . sure , it be go to be really hard to hit tb for most people , but think of the future . they be try to shift an unlimited commodity ( which be bad for them ) to a limited one . the price and reasonableness of the cap at this moment do n't really matter , because they be under no obligation to change it and consumer data demand be only increase .	obese_robot	1430578473	20	0

So, comparable to Tesla Model S at 265 mile range according to EPA.   I don't know much about the Chevy Bolt but if I had to pick one I'd be leaning towards Tesla, just because I like the way they're able to upgrade your car with OTA updates. It seems like a nice future proofing the Chevy wouldn't have, although the Tesla repair bills are apparently quite high so that's another consideration.

There are likely multiple profiles built by multiple companies about a given individual. However, if we're talking about [Name] [Address] [SSN] being associated with a given profile, I would say that is kept private most of the time.  EDIT: But the credit bureau profile on a person is publicly available (for a price) and gives a significant portion of that information.	that really depend on how they 're define `` personal information .

What I mean by safety is not the safety of train automation itself but for the passengers in the event of a natural disaster. The UK train network is not widly automated because if a train derails/tunnel collapses/fire breaks out, having a human representative that is trained to assist the passengers is essential.  Otherwise you end up with hundreds of scared passengers running around a live rail network having no idea what to do. You'd be suprsied how important an authority figure is during disaster.	autonomous train be not around for safety reason mostly . what i mean by safety be not the safety of train automation itself but for the passenger in the event of a natural disaster . the uk train network be not widly automate because if a train derails/tunnel collapses/fire break out , have a human representative that be train to assist the passenger be essential . otherwise you end up with hundred of scared passenger run around a live rail network have no idea what to do . you 'd be suprsied how important an authority figure be during disaster .	mishka_shaw	1431341315	4	0

A solar panel (2m^2) produces about 1kWh per day (Average for the year, much less in the winter). So you'd need 42 panels. It'd probably cost you over $50K for the solar setup alone.  Plus installation and such.  42 panels would be about 84 square meters or 900 square feet. You actually could get panels which are a bit more efficient, let's say 600 square feet (60 square meters). You have to put these on the south or west side of your roof, east isn't as good, north is really terrible.	if you want to daily cycle , you have to have the $ unit . that would be unit , $ . a solar panel ( ) produce about per day ( average for the year , much less in the winter ) . so you 'd need panel . it 'd probably cost you over $ for the solar setup alone . plus installation and such . panel would be about square meter or square foot . you actually could get panel which be a bit more efficient , let 's say square foot ( square meter ) . you have to put these on the south or west side of your roof , east be n't as good , north be really terrible .	happyscrappy	1430495258	1	0

We could just wait until it randomly spews out an equation and directions for how to use it immediately after.. :) Might take longer but hey, quantum and such gigaflops etc.	well thats why i be say it would spit out load of equation that be useless . but if a program can condense equation ( like be really ) you could probably compare those equation to know equation . im not sure of course , i know little about program . but if we could compare it to equations we already have we would at least know if it already exist or not . then again ... we could just wait until it randomly spew out an equation and direction for how to use it immediately after.. :) might take long but hey , quantum and such gigaflops etc .	kazuri85	1431230397	1	0

I don't know if they can, but conventional computers can already use theorem provers to prove that some (but not all) statements logically follow from axioms.	it seem as if you want to know if quantum computer can perform automated theorem discovery where a program start with a set of mathematical axiom and then derive a set of undiscovered theorem from them . i do n't know if they can , but conventional computer can already use theorem provers to prove that some ( but not all ) statement logically follow from axiom .	nyx210	1431232235	6	0

But it's handy to have x86 compatibility, for legacy software and other stuff that hasn't yet been ported.

Some of the best shows airing right now are only on cable TV like The Flash, Person of Interest, The Walking Dead latest episodes, and etc. Out of the big three TV services Hulu and Amazon are the ones that get the latest shows and episodes.   Amazon makes you buy new episodes and Hulu has very annoying ads. There isn't just one service that is just good. Plus every cable TV network is going to want there own subscription service. Then what do you know people got like 8 subscriptions for a few shows.

Reminds me a lot of the Guildford Four in Britain in the 1980s, 4 random Irish people stitched up and forced to sign false confessions for blowing up a bar, just after Thatcher passed internment laws in response to terrorism and there was pressure on the police for results in the hysteria.  I'm not saying everyone in Gitmo is a saint, but they should have a fair trial. The fact that many are released into other countries without much fuss is an indication that they aren't raging maniacs.	yeah adam curtis ' doc 'the power of nightmare ' detail that many of the al queda / taliban hand over be ordinary dude round up and pass off as bad dude for the reward money . remind me a lot of the guildford four in britain in the , random irish people stitch up and force to sign false confession for blow up a bar , just after thatcher pass internment law in response to terrorism and there be pressure on the police for result in the hysteria . i 'm not say everyone in gitmo be a saint , but they should have a fair trial . the fact that many be release into other country without much fuss be an indication that they be n't rag maniac .	spacedawg_ie	1431222641	7	0
