I hid it under the insulation incase the guys wife popped up to have a look.  I forgot to put it back when I left.   Got a call 2 days later by the husband asking about when I would be back to repair the air conditioning, and he had this tone in his voice that was asking what I did with the porn dvd.  I could hear his wife in the back ground so I didn't mention anything about it.   Probably thinks I took it for myself. 	i once find a porn dvd when i go in someone 's crawl space . it be leave next to the manhole ontop of the insulation . i hide it under the insulation incase the guy wife pop up to have a look . i forget to put it back when i leave . get a call day later by the husband ask about when i would be back to repair the air conditioning , and he have this tone in his voice that be ask what i do with the porn dvd . i could hear his wife in the back ground so i do n't mention anything about it . probably think i take it for myself .	veganhitler	1430733741	1	0

The quotient of the last line is 1.44 which is way off. 3)  If you only add a letter "D" you get a quotient of 1.68 and when you add a "." you get a quotient 1.92 which is closer to our mean quotient of 1.8-2.0.	explanation : they scrap off the paint and leave a dot from the bottom leave part of the `` d '' . edit : i 'll even go far and say that they remove a `` d '' and a `` .

Local zoologists in the northern  Colorado region were unsure why the Black Bear population was dwindling.  It was initially presumed that humans invading their territory were interfering with their hunting and mating territories.  However, Dr. Hardongton from the University of Colorado introduced a radical idea that fertilizers from the local farms were decreasing the bear's sperm count.  Locals were encouraged to venture out and stimulate the bears genitals to encourage sperm production.  The experiment was an overwhelming success for the bear population although an seemingly unrelated large amount of missing person cases later happened in the region.	direct human interaction to determine animal pattern in the wild be n't uncommon . local zoologist in the northern colorado region be unsure why the black bear population be dwindle . it be initially presume that human invade their territory be interfere with their hunting and mating territory . however , dr. hardongton from the university of colorado introduce a radical idea that fertilizer from the local farm be decrease the bear 's sperm count . local be encourage to venture out and stimulate the bear genitals to encourage sperm production . the experiment be an overwhelming success for the bear population although an seemingly unrelated large amount of miss person case later happen in the region .	wiiya	1432826618	65	0

Only once the bears learned that the genital stimulators were not in fact bears, did they perceive them to be a threat to their cubs and maul them. 	after notice the the alarming increase in disappearance of northern colorado farmer , dr. barry lover make the correlation that individual who have be urge to stimulate bear genitalia be become so aroused themselves , that the bear be mistake them for mat partner sand run off with them into the wood to mate . only once the bear learn that the genital stimulators be not in fact bear , do they perceive them to be a threat to their cub and maul them .

If they get really pissed they'll just ball up, which they do with such strength odds are you'll get your fingers stuck inside before you'd successfully keep the hedgehog from closing.	bad thing be this be probably her own fault . have own a hedgehog , i can confirm that they can bite much hard than you 'd expect , but it 's usually when they be try to figure out if something be edible . most of the time they sniff a bit , then lick the surface , and then go for the bite . you get a warning that bite might happen . if they get really piss they 'll just ball up , which they do with such strength odds be you 'll get your finger stick inside before you 'd successfully keep the hedgehog from closing .

When we turned them in we were pretty much all told "that's too complicated" and told what to make.

I go to a top 500 high school in the us run by funding from sports (one of those rich white neighborhoods) and I can tell you from experience, these coaches take the easiest jobs possible, again, speaking from personal experience. I had the head football coach for "financial literacy" and the class consisted either of his daily football stories or a worksheet he had simply googled in 5 minutes that day (and I know because he would have the page open on the projected too) . Basketball coach, baseball coach etc all fulfill similar positions.

No, I don't care about being able to access facebook on my printer from the fucking pathetic 1.9" screen. Stop. Focus on making a printer that doesnt take a proverbial shit every 2.5 pages it prints. How about making it turn on in under 10 minutes, or be able to stay on a static fucking IP address reliably. Is that too much to ask? holy fuck.

How can you automatically assume the guy was being an idiot? What if he had a heart attack or seizure etc.    If it was someone in my family or a friend who crashed and got injured and I saw some asshole shrug it off I would want to find him and murder him. 	why do stuff like this seem to happen exclusively in foreign country ? in america i do n't think i know a single person who would react this way . people almost always rush to help . i remember once see a child get run over in china and like people walk by and do n't stop . what the hell ? how can you automatically assume the guy be be an idiot ? what if he have a heart attack or seizure etc . if it be someone in my family or a friend who crash and get injured and i saw some asshole shrug it off i would want to find him and murder him .

05_15545	t1_crqzq2l	null	I remember this time I parked my car in Wildwood NJ before going to a bar. I planned on having one drink and bring my roommates home. They got there way before me. I ended up having a few more and knew I couldn't drive anymore. So I asked the cop on the street if I would get a ticket if I left my car there and he said yes. I told him I was drunk but he still wanted me to move it. I called the police station in front of him and they gave me permission to leave it! Fuck him. 	i remember this time i park my car in wildwood nj before go to a bar . i plan on have one drink and bring my roommate home . they get there way before me . i end up have a few more and know i could n't drive anymore . so i ask the cop on the street if i would get a ticket if i leave my car there and he say yes . i tell him i be drunk but he still want me to move it . i call the police station in front of him and they give me permission to leave it ! fuck him .	iaro	1433094613	8	0

05_03696	t1_cr2dxim	t1_cr1y207	I've never understood why people get so up in arms about food being "wasted". The amount of meat and produce that doesn't even make it to the shelves of the stores we buy from is completely insane. We produce a surplus of food because market forces and phenomenon such as economy of scale mean it is actually cheaper to produce the excess than it is to produce the exact amount that we consume.   Needless to say, someone paid for the stuff that went into that burger so they are entitled to do whatever they want with it.   By your logic, collectors are "wasting" the toys that they buy and then leave in their original packaging because someone else could be playing with said toy. 	i 've never understand why people get so up in arm about food be `` waste '' . the amount of meat and produce that do n't even make it to the shelf of the store we buy from be completely insane . we produce a surplus of food because market force and phenomenon such as economy of scale mean it be actually cheap to produce the excess than it be to produce the exact amount that we consume . needle to say , someone pay for the stuff that go into that burger so they be entitle to do whatever they want with it . by your logic , collector be `` waste '' the toy that they buy and then leave in their original packaging because someone else could be play with say toy .

And it's from all over the world, not just where ever he is located, which means it *really* shouldn't be any of his concern. The guy clearly has an agenda that he's trying to spread, and the mods didn't take too kindly to it. Idk whether the mods are right or wrong(free speech and what not), but it's not a simple "hurr durr mods are literally Hitler" scenario as he makes it out to be. Both parties are clearly at fault there.	have you take a look at his post history ? it 's all basically woman hating/racist news story . sort by top and you 'll see . and it 's from all over the world , not just where ever he be locate , which mean it *really* should n't be any of his concern . the guy clearly have an agenda that he 's try to spread , and the mod do n't take too kindly to it . idk whether the mod be right or wrong ( free speech and what not ) , but it 's not a simple `` hurr durr mod be literally hitler '' scenario as he make it out to be . both party be clearly at fault there .	breathethisair	1432577282	1	0

Smaller owls will 'deflate' when they encounter a larger predator in an attempt to look like a stick for camouflage. In the US, sometimes birders and other bystanders can stress out a Long-eared Owl, which adopts the same method. Because of this, the location of Long-eareds is never shared publicly.

For example, the 7 o'clock train might arrive at 7:08 consistently for several weeks, and then one day you show up at 7:03 and it's already leaving the station.  Technically, they didn't do anything wrong, but when it means you're now going to be 20 minutes late for work, it's not too hard to stomp your feet and yell at the train.	well , i can tell you that when it 's your daily commute , it can get frustrating . these train be typically just consistent enough to trick you into think you can count on them . for example , the o'clock train might arrive at consistently for several week , and then one day you show up at and it 's already leave the station . technically , they do n't do anything wrong , but when it mean you 're now go to be minute late for work , it 's not too hard to stomp your foot and yell at the train .	ibid49	1432666623	1	0

You can't really knock him, he's fighting in a way that gives him the optimal amount of points and exposes himself to the least amount of physical harm within the construct of the rules. These guys are the last two big names in this sport, and when they're done, so goes boxing. I can't think of another Boxing PPV event in the last 5 years that was even remotely noteworthy that didn't involve one of these two guys. 	... and expose fundamental flaw of a die sport that have fail to make change or adapt to the modern era . i do n't watch the fight because i know mayweather would win , and i know how he would do so . you ca n't really knock him , he 's fight in a way that give him the optimal amount of point and expose himself to the least amount of physical harm within the construct of the rule . these guy be the last two big name in this sport , and when they 're do , so go box . i ca n't think of another boxing ppv event in the last year that be even remotely noteworthy that do n't involve one of these two guy .	penis_showing_game	1430669732	6	0

05_01171	t1_cqww0h1	null	I saw this one fight where this one guy would not stop clinching, over and over and over for the whole fight. After a few rounds the ref started telling him to stop doing it so much, but he kept going. Near the end of the fight, still mostly just clinching the whole time, the ref began to get pissed and was really kind of angrily telling the guy to stop clinching so much.  Shouldn't there be a limit on it if it's going to be used as a prime strategy? Like maximum 24 clinches or whatever? I mean why should it be ok to just do it every time you are in danger over and over? It seems so cheap.	i saw this one fight where this one guy would not stop clinching , over and over and over for the whole fight . after a few round the ref start tell him to stop do it so much , but he keep go . near the end of the fight , still mostly just clinch the whole time , the ref begin to get pissed and be really kind of angrily tell the guy to stop clinch so much . should n't there be a limit on it if it 's go to be use as a prime strategy ? like maximum clinch or whatever ? i mean why should it be ok to just do it every time you be in danger over and over ? it seem so cheap .	sirgallium	1430657951	6	0

As for resources, can't argue there. You need a large stock of animals to start with as well as the years and patience.

The difference being that closed caption explains sounds like that so a deaf person can understand a scene vs a hearing person who just wants to understand what they are saying. A good example of this is when an actor is mouthing words silently they would caption it so that a deaf person understand that the captioning is not broken or missing a section.  Or in this case they tell you that they are speaking a foreign language to explain why there isn't any captioning.	that 's usually more on closed captioning ( which be for deaf people ) vs. subtitle which be design for watch a program that 's voice in a language you do n't understand . the difference be that close caption explain sound like that so a deaf person can understand a scene v a hearing person who just want to understand what they be say . a good example of this be when an actor be mouth word silently they would caption it so that a deaf person understand that the captioning be not break or miss a section . or in this case they tell you that they be speak a foreign language to explain why there be n't any captioning .	naturalorange	1431838536	5	0

A pie made with fresh dough has a distinctly different texture, and it also cooks inconsistently. With fresh dough you get more anomalies in the crust, like bubbles and uneven browning. Fresh dough is also less malleable and it's difficult to work with. You need _at least_ 6 hours to let the dough rise, but overnight is the best.  On the flip side, dough that's more than a couple days old is equally as bad as fresh dough.

I personally love it but would never talk about it, and I don't know anyone around me that constantly talks about it, but yes, it is that good to people that like it.  Caffeine is a drug after all and it's very addicting.

Campus security came sauntering up, flashlight at the ready, prepared to take down a would be burglar. It was hilarious for my friends and I as we watched from the front window of our house and both the cop and the security officer seemed to get a good chuckle out of it as well.	in college i rent a house across the street from the main campus . once i saw a cop patrol near one of the dorm building and thought i would have a bit of fun . i call the campus security hotline and report a suspicious look man dress in all black loitering and look around the dorm and ask if they could send someone to investigate . campus security come saunter up , flashlight at the ready , prepared to take down a would be burglar . it be hilarious for my friend and i as we watch from the front window of our house and both the cop and the security officer seem to get a good chuckle out of it as well .	pfrizzle	1430956913	52	0

It makes it easier to deal with a single figure in diplomacy.

In baseball, a pitcher will intentionally walk a slugger instead of risking a home run by trying to strike him out. All of these strategies maybe be boring, but they are part of the sport, they make champions, and are respected by fans who truly understand the sport.

Sitting inside is like an echo chamber for depression and negative feelings. You need to force yourself to go outside, and do something active to distract yourself from the negativity. It will release endorphins, change your body chemistry, and help remedy the issue. Its not a cure, but its an effective treatment. 	i hate to say it , mainly because every reply to this will be how im , but it kinda be this easy , go outside , explore , see something new , ride the bus somewhere , ride a bike , get high and skate around , do something . sit inside be like an echo chamber for depression and negative feeling . you need to force yourself to go outside , and do something active to distract yourself from the negativity . it will release endorphin , change your body chemistry , and help remedy the issue . its not a cure , but its an effective treatment .

05_06684	t1_cr881kf	t1_cr86gwv	Thing is, it wouldn't be hard at all to design a slightly offset model. It looks a little bit silly when the weapon is centered directly under your eyeline, down the center of your face, when in reality you would be able to see and (depending on what you're holding/wearing) have to compensate for that slight offset. In typical handguns and rifles it becomes an issue of posture and eye dominance but are easy to subconsciously compensate for. If you're wearing a gas mask or something, aiming a rifle suddenly becomes unwieldy and the weapon is offset much further.	thing be , it would n't be hard at all to design a slightly offset model . it look a little bit silly when the weapon be center directly under your eyeline , down the center of your face , when in reality you would be able to see and ( depend on what you 're holding/wearing ) have to compensate for that slight offset . in typical handgun and rifle it become an issue of posture and eye dominance but be easy to subconsciously compensate for . if you 're wear a gas mask or something , aim a rifle suddenly become unwieldy and the weapon be offset much far .	cocoa_thundabean	1431553726	4	0

They pay your tuition and give you around 20k a year stipend for TA or intro lab work.  A masters costs you money and doesn't really increase your earning potential.

He came upon an angry mother grizzly that charged him before he knew it was there. He knew he could never outrun it so he pulled out his knife, raised it high over head, stood his ground and waited. When the bear made contact he used the force of the impact to increase the power of his downward thrust, burying the knife into the base of the grizzly's neck, killing it. He then calmly walked to the nearest farm to have his wounds treated.	a handful of year ago a hunter be scout a location near my home for a future hunt trip carry only a hunt knife . he come upon an angry mother grizzly that charge him before he know it be there . he know he could never outrun it so he pull out his knife , raise it high over head , stand his ground and wait . when the bear make contact he use the force of the impact to increase the power of his downward thrust , bury the knife into the base of the grizzly 's neck , kill it . he then calmly walk to the near farm to have his wound treat .

Any adult understands the laws, morals, and consequences around attacking someone else. If a man attacks a woman it's wrong and he should expect the woman to defend herself and/or face legal consequences. If a woman attacks a man she should expect the same. A child is helpless and should be protected. The point I'm trying to make is women are not a helpless class that should be considered for extra protection that men don't receive. It's pretty insulting to them as a gender and does not promote equality.	a child have little to no understanding of the consequence of attack someone else . any adult understand the law , moral , and consequence around attack someone else . if a man attack a woman it 's wrong and he should expect the woman to defend herself and/or face legal consequence . if a woman attack a man she should expect the same . a child be helpless and should be protect . the point i 'm try to make be woman be not a helpless class that should be consider for extra protection that men do n't receive . it 's pretty insult to them as a gender and do not promote equality .

If a weaker adult attacks a stronger adult they should expect the other to defend themselves and face legal consequences. Same for the other way around.

I mean all AC's do it move heat from one place to another which might be useful if you have your ass plopped in one small space outdoors and there isn't a strong breeze.  	outdoor ac might start to be the kinda thing we 'll see people do when we all have solar panel on our roof and we be not pay $ $ $ $ per kwhr . and yes the concept could work , you just put the compressor somewhere else , like foot away or something , to be place down breeze of the heat exchanger . i mean all ac 's do it move heat from one place to another which might be useful if you have your as plop in one small space outdoors and there be n't a strong breeze .	nordoceltic	1431349617	-6	0

America can use Mjolnir for this reason.

Had the supposed bug inside the cup done this, pressed with enough force to burst through, it would need leverage, and the lower walls would be pried inward. But they are not. In fact, even the bottom part of the hole still has the appearance of being pressed outward, so though someone was holding the cup, and pushing something through it. Also, there are no identified bite marks, which is about the only way any insect could cut through Styrofoam. 	hole be probably make by a finger . the wall of the cup around the hole , most notably on the top , be stress outward . have the suppose bug inside the cup do this , press with enough force to burst through , it would need leverage , and the low wall would be pry inward . but they be not . in fact , even the bottom part of the hole still have the appearance of be press outward , so though someone be hold the cup , and push something through it . also , there be no identified bite mark , which be about the only way any insect could cut through styrofoam .

After about a week, a coworker remarked that I had aluminium rims. I looked at my wheels and had to accede that, yes, or maybe, or I don't know. Then I checked the model info, and indeed, that particular model is specced with aluminium rims from the factory.   On the other hand, navigation in the built in dash computer costs 600 bucks extra. I'd rather swap the two. 	i recently buy a used car . i really do n't care about the exterior ; for me , it 's a tool to get me from a to b . after about a week , a coworker remark that i have aluminium rim . i look at my wheel and have to accede that , yes , or maybe , or i do n't know . then i check the model info , and indeed , that particular model be specced with aluminium rim from the factory . on the other hand , navigation in the built in dash computer cost buck extra . i 'd rather swap the two .	noreallyimthepope	1430562602	-11	0

There's still cardboard boxes full of half price (sometimes 5 dollar) comics. There's still signings and writer workshops. There's still artist corner and plenty of booths and freebies. But yeah. If you've never been, I don't know why you would possibly complain anyways. The only real complaints I hear from other comic book geeks is how hard tickets are to come by.
